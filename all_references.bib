@article{Washburn2017a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Meteorological Society.A new method is described employing small drone aircraft for antenna pattern measurements (APMs) of high-frequency (HF) oceanographic radars used for observing ocean surface currents. Previous studies have shown that accurate surface current measurements using HF radar require APMs. The APMs provide directional calibration of the receive antennas for direction-finding radars. In the absence of APMs, so-called ideal antenna patterns are assumed and these can differ substantially from measured patterns. Typically, APMs are obtained using small research vessels carrying radio signal sources or transponders in circular arcs around individual radar sites. This procedure is expensive because it requires seagoing technicians, a vessel, and other equipment necessary to support small-boat operations. Furthermore, adverse sea conditions and obstacles in the water can limit the ability of small vessels to conduct APMs. In contrast, it is shown that drone aircraft can successfully conduct APMs at much lower cost and in a broader range of sea states with comparable accuracy. Drone-based patterns can extend farther shoreward, since they are not affected by the surfzone, and thereby expand the range of bearings over which APMs are determined. This simplified process for obtaining APMs can lead to more frequent calibrations and improved surface current measurements.},

abstract = {A near-real-time and offline quality control methodology for SeaSonde systems is proposed. It is applied on radial current maps and is based on the determination of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values of the Doppler lines that contribute to the hourly radial current at each range-bearing (R, $\theta$) pair, under the assumption that SNR is a proxy for radar data quality. The retrieval of the sequence of Doppler lines is performed through a minimization procedure that takes advantage of the statistical descriptors output in the short-term radial maps. The separation of the contributing Doppler velocities into valid observations and anomalous velocities is based on their spectral quality factor and on a range-dependent noise threshold derived from statistics (average and standard deviation) of the signal amplitudes in the tails of the Doppler spectra. The final product of the quality control procedure is a radial current map, in which Doppler velocities are weighted by their SNR values and their spectral quality factors, and averaged to produce an output that is fully compatible with the proprietary software. This procedure is fast, despite the fact that a large number of combinations might be required during the retrieval of the Doppler lines, and effective, because it removes both evident spikes as well as Doppler velocities that are not clearly identified as anomalous velocities. In principle, this approach can be used to fill gaps in the radar coverage without the need for interpolation in time or space, proved that the Doppler velocities satisfy predetermined SNR constraints.},

abstract = {Maximum likelihood (ML) estimation in array signal processing for the stochastic noncoherent signal case is well documented in the literature. We focus on the equally relevant case of stochastic coherent signals. Explicit large-sample realizations are derived for the ML estimates of the noise power and the (singular) signal covariance matrix. The asymptotic properties of the estimates are examined, and some numerical examples are provided. In addition, we show the surprising fact that the ML estimates of the signal parameters obtained by ignoring the information that the sources are coherent coincide in large samples with the ML estimates obtained by exploiting the coherent source information. Thus, the ML signal parameter estimator derived for the noncoherent case (or its large-sample realizations) asymptotically achieves the lowest possible estimation error variance (corresponding to the coherent Cramer-Rao bound)},

abstract = {In this paper, a new subspace-based algorithm for parametric estimation of angular parameters of multiple incoherently distributed sources is proposed. This approach consists of using the subspace principle without any eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix, so that it does not require the knowledge of the effective dimension of the pseudosignal subspace, and therefore the main difficulty of the existing subspace estimators can be avoided. The proposed idea relies on the use of the property of the inverse of the covariance matrix to exploit approximately the orthogonality property between column vectors of the noise-free covariance matrix and the sample pseudonoise subspace. The resulting estimator can be considered as a generalization of the Pisarenko's extended version of Capon's estimator from the case of point sources to the case of incoherently distributed sources. Theoretical expressions are derived for the variance and the bias of the proposed estimator due to finite sample effect. Compared with other known methods with comparable complexity, the proposed algorithm exhibits a better estimation performance, especially for close source separation, for large angular spread and for low signal-to-noise ratio.},

The tidal range in the region of study is one of the highest in the world and the coastal circulation is completely dominated by tides. The radar data resolve two modes which account for 97{\%} of the variability of the surface current velocities, with the major contribution of the first mode. This mode accounts for oscillating tidal currents whereas the second mode represents motions emerging from the interaction of tidal currents with capes and islands (eddy in the vicinity of the Point of Grouin and jet south of Chausey). A fortnightly modulation of the modal amplitudes causes the exceptional (more than 600{\%}) variability of currents which is well captured by the VHFR observations. The radar data revealed that tidal circulation in the region is flood-dominated with a strong asymmetry of current velocity curve. Wind events and fortnightly variability affect the course of tidal cycle by modifying the magnitude and duration of ebb and flood. In addition to expected features of coastal circulation (tidally dominated flow, eddies) and high wind-current coupling, the residual currents revealed a strong cross-shore structure in the mean and a significant variability which has the same order of magnitude. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Phytoplankton are a major food resource for filter-feeding organisms occupying intertidal and subtidal habitats of the inner continental shelf. Phytoplankton in these nearshore waters experience different anthropogenic and natural forcing compared to those offshore such that cross-shelf exchange would allow phytoplankton that were produced offshore to serve as a subsidy to inner shelf consumers when phytoplankton production on the shelf is negatively impacted. In the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC) the continental shelf is only a few kilometers wide facilitating exchange with offshore waters. Physical, chemical and biological gradients were examined monthly along a 3-km cross-shelf transect in the SBC from January, 2008 through April, 2009. Chemical and biological distributions followed temporal changes in physical forcing with higher nutrient concentrations and a more intense period of biological production associated with spring upwelling. Chlorophyll was relatively evenly distributed across the shelf during upwelling, but was present at higher concentrations on the inner shelf under stratified conditions. Similarly, cross-shelf gradients in the distribution of dominant phytoplankton genera were weakest during upwelling when blooms of the prymnesiophyte, . Phaeocystis, and the diatoms, . Eucampia spp. and . Thalassiosira spp. occurred across most of the shelf. Upon stratification, blooms were largely confined to the inner shelf within 0.75. km of the shoreline with an initial bloom of the diatom . Leptocylindrus spp. followed by . Pseudo-nitzschia spp. and series of dinoflagellate blooms with . Prorocentrum spp. and . Lingulodinium spp. attaining the highest abundances. Phytoplankton taxonomic similarity decreased with increasing distance separating stations along the transect and was inversely related to stratification intensity. The observed distribution patterns and the trends in taxonomic similarity imply that for most of the year consumers within rocky intertidal and subtidal ecosystems on the inner shelf are exposed to phytoplankton produced on the continental shelf, and often on the inner shelf. The contribution of phytoplankton produced beyond the shelf break occurs mainly during spring upwelling. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The complex dynamics associated with coastal buoyant plumes make it difficult to document the interactions between light availability, phytoplankton carbon fixation, and biomass accumulation. Using real-time data, provided by satellites and high frequency radar, we adaptively sampled a low salinity parcel of water that was exported from the Hudson river estuary in April 2005. The water was characterized by high nutrients and high chlorophyll concentrations. The majority of the low salinity water was re-circulated within a nearshore surface feature for 5 days during which nitrate concentrations dropped 7-fold, the maximum quantum yield for photosynthesis dropped 10-fold, and primary productivity rates decreased 5-fold. Associated with the decline in nitrate was an increase in phytoplankton biomass. The phytoplankton combined with the Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) and non-algal particles attenuated the light so the 1{\%} light level ranged between 3 and 10. m depending on the age of the plume water. As the plume was 10-15. m thick, the majority of the phytoplankton were light-limited. Vertical mixing within the plume was high as indicated by the dispersion of injected of rhodamine dye. The mixing within the buoyant plume was more rapid than phytoplankton photoacclimation processes. Mixing rates within the plume was the critical factor determining overall productivity rates within the turbid plume. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

As an example, we discuss the resolution of two complex exponentials with closely spaced frequencies.

abstract = {Surface currents measured by High Frequency (HF) radar are used to investigate the dynamics in the coastal waters of Qingdao, China, on the western coast of the Yellow Sea. Different factors affecting the surface currents are revealed by dynamical analysis. Harmonic tidal analysis shows that the coastal tidal currents are barotropic and their temporal evolution is mainly influenced by the semidiurnal tidal constitutes, topography and geometry. It is also found that their horizontal distribution represents the effect of local topography. At sub-tidal frequencies, the high correlation between winds and the sub-tidal surface currents indicates a crucial role of wind-forcing in driving the currents. Varying wind direction coupled with small-scale features of the coastal geometry results in complicated sub-mesoscale circulation. In addition, the monthly coastal circulation is characterized by an eddy structure and is primarily determined by the outflow which is closely associated with the sea level slope along the coast. The variability of the residual currents is studied by analyzing the cross-shore momentum equation with wind stress, sea level records, and HF radar currents. It is shown that both the barotropic pressure gradient and the nonlinear tidal stress contribute to the variations of the residual currents near the bay mouth and further govern the coastal monthly circulation in August, 2008.},

A wave-height correction factor was developed that explicitly considers this scale separation and eliminates the trend of increasing errors with increasing wind speed.},

On the nontraditional f plane, because of the horizontal component of the earth's rotation for waves of inertial band with frequencies slightly below the local inertial frequency f, there is a waveguide in the mixed layer confined from below by the pycnocline. It is argued that when the stratification is shallow these waves are most easily and strongly excited by varying winds as near-inertial oscillations (NIOs). These motions have been overlooked in previous studies because they are absent under the traditional approximation. The observations that employed buoys with thermistors, ADCPs, and two 16.3-MHz Wellen Radar (WERA) HF radars were carried out in the Gulf of Lion in April–June 2006. The observations support the theoretical picture: a pronounced inertial band response occurs only in the presence of shallow stratification and is confined ...},

abstract = {Automated eddy detection methods are fundamental tools to analyze eddy activity from the large datasets derived from satellite measurements and numerical model simulations. Existing methods are either based on the distribution of physical parameters usually computed from velocity derivatives or on the geometry of velocity streamlines around minima or maxima of sea level anomaly. A new algorithm was developed based exclusively on the geometry of the velocity vectors. Four constraints characterizing the spatial distribution of the velocity vectors around eddy centers were derived from the general features associated with velocity fields in the presence of eddies. The grid points in the domain for which these four constraints are satisfied are detected as eddy centers. Eddy sizes are computed from closed contours of the streamfunction field, and eddy tracks are retrieved by comparing the distribution of eddy centers at successive time steps. The results were validated against manually derived eddy fields. Two parameters in the algorithm can be modified by the users to optimize its performance. The algorithm is applied to both a high-resolution model product and high-frequency radar surface velocity fields in the Southern California Bight.},

abstract = {Key Points •Warm poleward flows often follow wind relaxations in coastal upwelling systems •Propagation speeds of the flows are controlled by temperature differences •The relaxation flows approach the slope-limit for buoyant plumes  Following relaxations of prevailing upwelling-favorable winds, warm waters from the Santa Barbara Channel propagate poleward around Point Conception and along the south central California coast. We examined characteristics of these relaxation flows, including frontal propagation speed and temperature changes during the warm water arrivals, by using multiyear time series of currents and temperatures from four moorings along the ∼15 m isobath, surface current observations from high-frequency radars, and satellite sea surface temperature images. Propagation speeds of the warm fronts relative to ambient waters ranged from 0.04 to 0.46 m s−1. As the fronts arrived at the moorings, temperature increases ranged from 0.7°C to 4.2°C. In ensemble averages over many frontal arrivals, alongshore flow speeds increased by 0.1–0.2 m s−1 over the water column during arrivals. Cross-shore flows were onshore near the surface and offshore near the bottom with speeds of 0.02–0.05 m s−1. This cross-shore flow structure persisted as temperature increased during arrivals and ceased when temperatures stopped increasing. Frontal propagation speeds were correlated with temperature increases at the moorings, consistent with forcing by baroclinic pressure gradients. Compared to other buoyant flows such as from the Chesapeake Bay where density contrasts with ambient waters are 2–3 kg m−3, these relaxation flows are less buoyant with density contrasts of 0.1–0.9 kg m−3. Consequently, the propagation of these flows is more affected by bottom friction and the speeds are closer to the “slope-controlled” or “bottom-advected” limit described in theoretical and laboratory work but not well studied in the ocean. },

The eddies are 4–15 km in diameter and typically last about 2 days, although some last up to 6 days. Most eddies within the radar coverage area are anti-cyclonic with relative vorticities of 0.4 f to 0.8 f where f is the Coriolis parameter, but cyclonic eddies are also observed. Moored observations over the inner shelf (12 m water depth) of a sequence of two eddies in December 2001 show an increase in nitrate plus nitrite from the background levels of 1–2 mM to a maximum of 10–12 mM when the eddies are present.

abstract = {The evolution of a submesoscale anticyclonic vortex was observed by high-frequency Doppler radio current meters and satellite radiometers. The vortex formed between two large cyclones to the southwest of Oahu, Hawaii. The radius of the core was 15 km; the azimuthal velocity reached 35 cm s-1; and the surface vorticity remained below -f for 9 days, reaching an extremum of -1.7f. The flow was ageostrophic near the center and around the periphery of the vortex. The initial growth may have been driven by negative wind stress curl in the lee of Oahu. The vortex was prone to inertial, symmetric, and anticyclonic ageostrophic instabilities, but the temporal evolution of radial profiles of vorticity was inconsistent with angular momentum redistribution by inertial instability. A tongue of surface water 0.7C warmer became entrained northward between the vortex and the colder cyclone to the west. As the vortex strengthened, a 0.14 C km-1 front formed along the eastern flank of the tongue. The sea surface temperature gradient remained weaker on the western flank. The flow was anticyclonic (-0.4f ) and divergent (0.1f ) on the warm side of the front but cyclonic (0.6f ) and convergent (-0.2f ) on the cold side. This suggests ageostrophic cross-frontal circulations maintaining alongfront thermal wind balance in the presence of large-scale strain S. Surface divergence d was proportional to vorticity zeta during the 3-day frontogenesis: d=-(S/f )zeta. This is consistent with a semigeostrophic model of a front confined to a surface layer of zero potential vorticity.},

Large seasonal variations in both the speed factor and deflection angle were found. The speed factor, which is defined here as the ratio of the wind-driven surface flow to the (waterside) friction velocity, is 7.7–9.5 in winter and 11.4–14.3 in summer, while the deflection angle is 17.7°–27.3° in winter and increases to 48.5°–67.3° in summer. A likely cause of these seasonal variations is the seasonal variation of the eddy viscosity profile. It was also found that the speed factor in winter increases with the friction velocity. This dependence is possibly explained by deepening of the wind-driven surface flow with increasing friction velocity: as the friction velocity increases, HF radar (whose measurement depth is fixed) tends to measure a shallower part of the wind-driven surface flow whose speed factor is larger.},

abstract = {[1] Observations taken during the Lagrangian Transport and Transformation Experiment (LaTTE) in 2005 indicated that the Hudson's river outflow formed a bulge of recirculating fluid that limits the volume of fresh water that is advected away in a coastal current. Focusing on an event that began with downwelling winds we made estimates of the fresh-water flux in the coastal current and the fresh water inventory of the bulge. The coastal current was characterized by a surface advected plume in thermal wind balance. However, the freshwater transport in the coastal current was less than 1/2 of the total freshwater outflow. The bulge extended 30 km from the coast and 40 km in the along-shore direction and was evident in ocean color imagery. Recirculation in the bulge region was also apparent in daily averaged surface current radar data, but this flow pattern was obscured in the hourly data by tidal and wind-forcing even in the diurnal band. Nevertheless, many aspects of the Hudson's outflow are consistent with recent laboratory experiments and numerical simulations of buoyant discharges. The growing bulge transports the river's outflow to the head of the Hudson shelf valley where it crosses the 50 m isobath. Previous work in this region indicates that frontal features reside along this isobath. We observed fresh water being transported along this isobath and is suggestive of a rapid cross-shelf transport pathway for fresh water. Both the bulge formation and cross-shelf transport have significant biogeochemical implications.},

Over a 20-min sample interval, the VHF radar mapped coastal ocean currents over a 7.5 km × 8 km domain with a horizontal resolution of 250 m at 700 grid points. A total of 2078 snapshots of the two-dimensional current vectors were acquired during this time series and of these samples, only 69 samples (3.3{\%}) were missing from the time series. During this period, complex surface circulation patterns were observed that included coherent, submesoscale vortices with diameters of 2 to 3 km inshore of the Florida Current. Comparisons to subsurface measurements from moored and ship-board acoustic Doppler current profiles revealed regression slopes of close to unity with biases ranging from 4 to 8 cm s-1 between surface and subsurface measurements at 3 to 4 m beneath the surface. Correlation coefficients were 0.8 or above with phases of -10 to -20° suggestive of an anticylconic veering of current with depth relative to the surface current.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The wind impulse response function and transfer function for high-frequency radar-derived surface currents off southern San Diego are calculated using several local wind observations. The spatial map of the transfer function reflects the influence of the coast on wind-current dynamics. Near the coast (within 20 km from the shoreline), the amplitudes of the transfer function at inertial and diurnal frequencies are reduced due to effects of coastline and bottom bathymetry. Meanwhile, the amplitude of low-frequency currents increases near the coast, which is attributed to the local geostrophic balance between cross-shore pressure gradients against the coast and currents. Locally wind-driven surface currents are estimated from the data-derived response function, and their power spectrum shows a strong diurnal peak superposed on a red spectrum, similar to the spectra of observed winds. Current magnitudes and veering angles to a quasi-steady wind are typically 2-5{\%} of the wind speed and vary 50 degrees-90 degrees to the right of the wind, respectively. A wind skill map is introduced to present the fractional variance of surface currents explained by local winds as a verification tool for wind data quality and relevance. Moreover, the transfer functions in summer and winter are presented to examine the seasonal variation in ocean surface current response to the wind associated with stratification change.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Over a 29-day time series in July 1999, an ocean surface current radar (OSCR) in very high frequency (VHF) mode mapped the surface velocity field at 250-m resolution at 700 cells off Fort Lauderdale, Florida. During the experiment, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), equipped with upward- and downward-looking 1.2-MHz acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs), measured subsurface current structure over four to six radar cells during two mixed layer patterns on 9 and 27 July 1999. As these AUV sampling patterns were conducted over 500 m × 500 m and 500 m × 750 m areas, these missions required about 80-90 min (four radar sample intervals) to form four and seven synoptic snapshots, respectively. Based on autocorrelation analyses of the profiler data, along-AUV-track subsurface profiles were averaged at 10-s intervals, mapped to a surface from 1.5-6.5 m. and compared to surface currents at more than 500 points for each snapshot. Comparisons between the surface and subsurface currents from the AUV revealed spatially averaged differences ranging from 4 to 26 cm s-1 during these two experiments. The largest differences occurred when the surface and subsurface current vectors were orthogonal; otherwise, differences were O(10 cm s-1). Scatterplots between 2-m and radar-derived surface currents indicated a consistent relationship with mooring data. From the seven spatial snapshots acquired during the second experiment, current profiles suggested a time-dependent oscillation that was corroborated by radar and moored ADCP data. Least squares fits of these profiles from sequential AUV snapshots to a simple model isolated an ∼9.2 ± 1 h oscillation where the along-shelf current was O(50 cm s-1 . Spatially averaged current profiles from four and seven snapshots were subsequently time averaged to form a mean profile from each experiment. In the downwind directions, these mean profiles were compared to a wind-driven, logarithmic layer profile in the upper 6.5 m based on a 10-m surface winds. Regression analyses suggest a slope of ≈1.16 between the theoretical and observed mean profiles with a bias of about 3 cm s-1. In this context, the averaged winds played a role in driving the coastal ocean circulation. These results further suggest that the spatial averaging by the radar is consistent when subsurface current variations are averaged over similar time and space scales.},

abstract = {Surface currents measured by high-frequency (HF) radars in southern San Diego are addressed from three perspectives: technical issues, physical interpretations, and environmental applications. Objective mapping (also known as optimal interpolation (OI)) is applied to the surface vector current using both observed and idealized covariance matrices. The mapping produces smooth fields and can fill in missing data. The covariance matrices calculated from the raw observations of surface currents show a roughly exponential form instead of the Gaussian shape which is often assumed. The OI methods have been extended to map vector current directly from the radial velocities as an alternative to un-weighted least-squares fitting (UWLS), which has been the default method for the HF radar community. OI uses the expected covariance function in place of the arbitrary, discontinuous correlation function used in UWLS. Moreover, the OI approach reduces inconsistency along baselines between stations and provides superior uncertainty measures for the estimated current field.},

abstract = {This article reviews the discovery, development, and use of high-frequency (HF) radio wave backscatter in oceanography. HF radars, as the instruments are commonly called, remotely measure ocean surface currents by exploiting a Bragg resonant backscatter phenomenon. Electromagnetic waves in the HF band (3-30 MHz) have wavelengths that are commensurate with wind-driven gravity waves on the ocean surface; the ocean waves whose wavelengths are exactly half as long as those of the broadcast radio waves are responsible for the resonant backscatter. Networks of HF radar systems are capable of mapping surface currents hourly out to ranges approaching 200 km with a horizontal resolution of a few kilometers. Such information has many uses, including search and rescue support and oil-spill mitigation in real time and larval population connectivity assessment when viewed over many years. Today, HF radar networks form the backbone of many ocean observing systems, and the data are assimilated into ocean circulation models.},

abstract = {Maritime domain awareness is important for coastal nations in terms of applications to coastal conservancy, security, fishery and stewardship of their exclusive economic zones (EEZs). Maritime situational awareness involves knowing the location, speed and bearing of ships and boats in the EEZ. HF radar is a useful tool in providing ship information in real time. It is especially effective when combined with information from ship-borne AIS beacons. Our previously developed HF radar and AIS ship detection models estimate signal to noise ratio (SNR) as a function of range, including ducted propagation for the AIS radio signals. However, ship detection is hampered by false targets related to wave echoes, interference and the high variability of HF echoes from ships. This is due in part to the aspect and frequency dependence of ship radar cross-section and to the presence of clutter bands at known Doppler shifts from both the ground and ocean surfaces. Distinguishing ship echoes from false alarm echoes is significantly aided by identifying radar targets with ship-like behavior. Thus, tracking ships using their HF radar echoes becomes an important means for effectively monitoring the presence of ships in the coastal ocean. We demonstrate the application of Kalman filtering to the ship-tracking problem with examples using data from the COCMP HF radar network along the California coast. As with other radar tracking problems, the Kalman approach proves effective in this application as well.},

Comparisons with a 3-D finite-element nonlinear numerical model of the tides show a good agreement for phases in the middle of the basin, although modeled currents amplitudes are overestimated. However, modeled phases lag observed phases by up to 50� (1.7 hours) for M 2 and 100� (6.7 hours) for K 1, and modeled amplitudes are underestimated, in a 10–20 km wide strip along the Italian coast.

abstract = {A time series of hourly surface current maps in the shelf waters off Newport, Oregon, was made during April–September 2001 using five SeaSonde HF current mappers, during Coastal Advances in Shelf Transport (COAST). The surface currents responded rapidly to the changing winds, in repeated patterns that were strongly affected by bottom topography. An equatorward current jet repeatedly formed in response to upwelling winds, its strength, but not its trajectory, covarying with the meridional wind stress. Near Cape Foulweather (44.8°N), where the shelf begins to widen, the jet rotates, weakens, and trends offshore to the south first along, then across, the isobaths. Below Cape Foulweather, inshore of the jet, a lee region of generally weak currents was commonly observed. The equatorward jet core was most commonly observed near the 80-m isobath between 45.0°N and 44.4°N, but transited offshore between spring and summer over Heceta Bank. At Newport (44.6°N), it was rarely observed less than 8 km from the coast. A second, inshore, equatorward jet, previously unknown, was observed repeatedly south of Waldport (44.4°N). Sustained downwelling wind episodes produced poleward currents, though less responsively north of Cape Foulweather. Strongest poleward flow was generally trapped near the coast. Surface currents were correlated with the northward wind, except regionally far from shore over Heceta Bank, responding within half a day. Response to the wind varies spatially, being intensified in the narrow shelf (northern) region. The equatorward jet persists through periods of zero wind forcing. Coastal sea level covaries with the meridional wind and the primary mode of ocean current response},

abstract = {Numerical modelling and HF radar technique are two developing methods for studying coastal circulation. They both have a wide space-coverage, and similar time and space discriminations (respectively a few minutes and a few km2). It is therefore particularly interesting to compare their results. An experiment using two high-frequency radars was made in Western Baie de Seine at the end of summer 1982, and three days of these measurements, covering a large range of tidal coefficients, have been compared with the corresponding results of a two-dimensional modelling of the whole Bay. Characteristics of this model, as well as the main methodological and technical points concerning HF radar measurements (especially a discussion of the measurements errors, evaluated to be 3 to 7 cm s-1 on each radial component) are presented. A comparison is made at 6 points for the current vector, and at 20 points for one of the radial components. It concerns the half-day mode (amplitude, phase, hodograph). In most of the area, no significant phase lag is observed. The agreement is to within ca. 10 cm s-1 for the amplitude, and to within less than 10?? for the bearing of tidal ellipses, with smaller intervals for smaller tides. This agreement shows that the intrinsic accuracy of the model is comparable to that of other sensors such as current meters. What is even more satisfactory is that the model does not use as boundary conditions any measurements specific to the period studied except for sea level forecasts, which are given by a greater scale physical model. A significant difference is observed only close to the coast where the strong gradient of the current velocity (referred to the discrimination scale), is unfavourable both to the model and to the measurements. ?? 1986.},

The comparison shows a fairly good agreement of the results ( the discrepancy does not exceed 15{\%}) and suggests a higher accuracy of the HF probing.},

abstract = {As an integral part of the WEST study of the role of wind-driven transport in shelf productivity, HF radar currents are analyzed to determine typical surface flow patterns off Bodega Bay in northern California. Radar-derived surface trajectories and surface velocity divergences are used to determine the proximal origins and destinations of surface waters in the area. Surface trajectory results show a strong bimodality, with water over the entire shelf originating in the north under upwelling conditions and waters over the inner/mid-shelf originating in the south during relaxation conditions. Outer shelf waters have more variable transport patterns during relaxation conditions, with limited equatorward or onshore movements being most typical. The destinations of surface waters starting at the outer shelf are predominantly offshore, with the majority of particles exiting the radar domain west of Pt Reyes along the shelf edge in less than 2 days. Significant proportions of water from the inner/mid-shelf are exported southward and exit the radar domain inshore or within 20 km of the tip of Pt Reyes, creating possibilities for either nearshore retention in the Bodega region or entrainment of water into the Gulf of Farallons. Approximately 15{\%} of all trajectories remained in the radar domain for 6 days, suggesting that a biologically significant percentage of larvae might be retained in the area for time periods approaching typical larval durations. Calculations of surface divergence indicate where vertical flux may be significant. An extensive area of positive divergence is observed off Bodega during upwelling conditions, while weakly convergent flow is observed where upwelling flows approach Pt Reyes. Positive divergence also is observed during relaxation periods when poleward flow separates from the shore just north of Pt Reyes. Estimates of vertical flux in these divergence zones point to a significant contribution of recently upwelled waters to the observed horizontal fluxes at the surface. Determination of the ultimate source and fate of phytoplankton-rich waters requires further analysis of the detailed time dependence of phytoplankton concentration relative to the time dependence of wind-forced currents. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this paper is to develop and apply a similar theory in higher dimensional spaces. While the sepa- ratrix nature of these structures is their most important property, a necessary con- dition is their almost material nature. This property is addressed in this paper. These results are applied to a model of Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection based on a three- dimensional extension of the model of Solomon and Gollub.},

abstract = {When upwelling favorable winds weaken or relax in coastal upwelling systems, prevailing equatorward currents often weaken and then reverse to form propagating poleward currents. Here the statistics of wind relaxations and poleward flow events along the south central California coast are derived using meteorological and oceanographic times series during 2000–2006. Over the 7-year record, 169 wind relaxations were observed (about 1 every 2 weeks) and 127 of these were followed by poleward flow events. Thermistor moorings and current profilers along the 15 m isobath at Alegria, Point Arguello, Point Purisima, and Point Sal recorded the poleward flows. The poleward flows propagate northward at 10–30 km d−1 and appear as sequential temperature increases at the moorings. Wind relaxations occur throughout the year but are most frequent in September and least frequent in April when upwelling winds are strong and persistent. Poleward flows follow wind relaxations frequently during May through November and rarely in December and January. Sea level differences between Santa Monica and Port San Luis, California, decreased as winds relaxed, consistent with forcing by alongshore pressure gradients. Temperature distributions at Point Arguello, Point Purisima, and Point Sal were skewed toward higher values because of the poleward flows. The alongshore distance traveled by the poleward flows increased with duration of the wind relaxations and magnitudes of alongshore temperature and sea level differences prior to the relaxations.  },

abstract = {In this paper, we describe a high-frequency (HF) radar capable of multifrequency operation over the HF band for dual-use application to ship classification and mapping ocean current shear and vector winds. The radar is based on a digital transceiver peripheral component interconnect (PCI) card family that supports antenna arrays of four to 32 elements with a single computer, with larger arrays possible using multiple computers and receiver cards. The radar makes use of broadband loop antennas for receive elements, and a number of different possibilities for transmit antennas, depending on the operating bandwidth desired. An option exists in the choice of monostatic or multistatic operation, the latter providing the ability to use several transmit sites, with all radar echo signal reception and processing conducted at a single master receiver site. As applications for such a multifrequency radar capability, we show measurement and modeling examples of multiple frequency HF radar cross section (RCS) of ships as an approach to ship target classification. Results of using 32 radar frequencies to measure the fine structure in ocean current vertical shear are also shown, providing evidence of one edge of a 1-3-m deep uniform flow masked at the surface by wind-driven current shear in a different direction. Other applications of current-shear measurements, such as vector wind mapping and volumetric current estimation in coastal waters, are also discussed.},

abstract = {Electromagnetic (EM) scattering from the sea surface concerned with second-order Doppler spectra for finite-length pulses is theoretically analyzed in the scattering regime typical of, but not confined to, high-frequency (HF) radars. The Doppler spectra of the second-order cross section consist of three different parts: continuum and two pairs of peaks-the second harmonic and corner reflection peaks. This paper is the first investigation of fundamental properties of these peaks from the perspective of their use in measurements of surface currents. It is shown that these peaks are of singular nature in the following sense: The main (singular) contribution is due to particular pairs of waves, despite the fact that waves of many different wavelengths and directions contribute to these peaks. This fact opens a possibility to employ these peaks in remote sensing of vertical profiles of surface currents. Using the number of waves in the pulse ("the pulse length") LGt1 as a large parameter, an asymptotic description of these peaks is developed. Height, width, and position of the peaks are explicitly found in terms of L. The peak positions, to the leading order, do not depend on the pulse length, although a small explicitly found O(L{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) shift has to be taken into account for the corner reflection peaks. The heights are {\~{}}lnL and {\~{}}L{\textless}sup{\textgreater}1/2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} for the second harmonic and corner reflection peaks, respectively. The results open the way for wider use of the second-order peaks for probing surface currents},

abstract = {This paper presents results of a trial of a Pisces HF radar system aimed at assessing its use as a component of a wave-monitoring network being installed around the coasts of England and Wales. The radar system has been operating since December 2003 and the trial continued to June 2005. The data have been processed in near-real time and displayed on a website. Radar measurements of the directional spectrum and derived parameters are compared with those measured with a directional waverider and with products from the Met Office, United Kingdom, operational wave model. Radar measurements of currents and winds are also compared with Met Office model products and, in the case of winds, with the QuikSCAT scatterometer. Statistics on data availability and accuracy are presented. The results demonstrate that useful availability and accuracy in wave and wind parameters are obtained above a waveheight threshold of 2 m and at ranges up to 120 km at the radar operating frequencies (7-10 MHz) used. Waveheight measurements above about 1 m can be made with reasonable accuracy (e.g., mean difference of 2.5{\%} during January-February 2004). Period and direction parameters in low seas are often contaminated by noise in the radar signal. The comparisons provide some evidence of wave model limitations in offshore wind and swell conditions},

abstract = {A method of the Helmholtz decomposition for mapped surface currents on grid points is developed. This method is simple, and decomposed currents are not dependent on the distance from the open boundary. This decomposition is applied to surface currents observed by high-frequency (HF) radars. The observation was conducted from April to May 1998 east of Okinawa Island, Japan. The spectral analysis of decomposed currents reveals that the M{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} tidal peak for rotational components is much smaller than that for divergent components, which suggests that the barotropic tidal components are mainly included in divergent currents. The real-vector empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of decomposed currents reveals an embedded eddy, which is related with the convergence of currents},

Sampling theory for buoy measurements is well known. The same theory can be applied to the impact of sampling on the estimation of high-frequency (HF) radar power spectra from which wave measurements are derived. Some work on the impacts on the HF radar wave measurements themselves is reviewed and applied to datasets obtained with three different radar systems, operating at different radio frequencies in different geographical locations. Comparisons with collocated buoy measurements are presented showing qualitative agreement with the sampling impact predictions but indicating that there are more sources of differences than can be explained by sampling. Increased averaging is applied to two of these datasets to demonstrate the improvement in data quality and quantity that can be obtained.},

abstract = {Coastal surface currents measured remotely by high frequency (HF) radar are compared with those from in situ acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCP) deployed in both Eulerian and Lagrangian configurations. Two 25 MHz CODAR SeaSondesreg, located at Cape May, NJ and Cape Henlopen, DE, continuously measure surface currents at the Delaware Bay mouth. The radars measure surface current hourly with a spatial resolution of approximately 1.5 km using ideal antenna patterns. Surface currents in this area are dominated by strong semidiurnal tidal exchange between the Delaware Bay and Atlantic Ocean, which can reach velocities of 190 cm/s. An upward looking 600 KHz ADCP with a vertical resolution of 0.5 m was deployed on a seafloor frame 1.5 km east of Cape Henlopen within the radar footprint for 38 days. A downward looking 600 KHz ADCP with a vertical resolution of 1 m was mounted on a research vessel and operated continuously along a transect within the radar footprint for 41 hours. Velocities from the uppermost complete bin of the seafloor mounted ADCP are compared with the nearest radar measurement. Velocities from the shallowest bin of the ship mounted ADCP are compared with the nearest radar measurement in both time and space. No interpolation was done. Regression analysis indicates correlation coefficients (R) between the radar and ADCPs of 0.8 to 0.9 for current magnitude and 0.7 to 0.8 for current direction. Complex correlation analysis yields correlation coefficients greater than 0.9 with the ADCP observations veering clockwise from the radar observations by 0.3deg to 0.6deg. The root mean square (RMS) difference of magnitudes indicates that radar measurements of surface current magnitude are 19.4{\%} greater than those made by the moored ADCP and 8.2{\%} less than those made by the ship ADCP.},

Previous work has provided a first-order approximation of these performance measures, which is valid for small modeling errors. In order to take into account larger errors and provide tools for designing an experimental setup, a more accurate (but still easy-to-use) performance analysis is necessary. For such an investigation, the DOA estimation errors are expressed as a Hermitian form with a stochastic vector composed of the modeling errors. Closed-form expressions relating the bias and RMS errors to the statistical moments of the modeling error are then deduced from the statistics of this Hermitian form. Simulations are provided to illustrate the usefulness of the theoretical results.},

abstract = {Eigenvectors of sample covariance matrices are used in a variety of statistical signal processing problems. The second-order statistics of these eigenvectors are needed to compute the variance of estimates based on these eigenvectors. Formulas for the second-order statistics of the eigenvectors have been derived in the statistical literature and are widely used. We point out a discrepancy between the statistics observed in numerical simulations and the theoretical formulas, due to the nonuniqueness of the definition of eigenvectors. We present two ways to resolve this discrepancy. The first involves modifying the theoretical formulas to match the computational results. The second involved a simple modification of the computations to make them match existing formulas},

abstract = {Most of our familiar statistical methods, such as hypothesis testing, linear regression, analysis of variance, and maximum likelihood estimation, were designed to be implemented on mechanical calculators. Modern electronic computation has encouraged a host of new statistical methods that require fewer distributional assumptions than their predecessors and can be applied to more complicated statistical estimators. These methods allow the scientist to explore and describe data and draw valid statistical inferences without the usual concerns for mathematical tractability. This is possible because traditional methods of mathematical analysis are replaced by specially constructed computer algorithms. Mathematics has not disappeared from statistical theory. It is the main method for deciding which algorithms are correct and efficient tools for automating statistical inference.},

abstract = { Subspace decomposition has been exploited in different applications. Due to perturbations from various sources such as finite data samples and measurement noise, perturbations arise in subspaces. Therefore, some loss is introduced to performance of subspace-based algorithms. Although first-order perturbation results have been proposed in the literature and applied to various problems, up to second-order perturbation analysis can provide more accurate analytical results and is studied in this paper. Based on the orthogonality principle, perturbations of subspaces and singular values (or eigenvalues) are derived explicitly as functions of a perturbation in the objective matrix up to the second-order, respectively, all in closed forms. It is shown that by keeping only the first-order terms, the derived results reduce to those from existing approaches. Examples to apply the proposed results to both matrix computation and subspace-based channel estimation are provided to verify our analysis.},

@article{Dunlosky2013,
abstract = {Many students are being left behind by an educational system that some people believe is in crisis. Improving educational outcomes will require efforts on many fronts, but a central premise of this monograph is that one part of a solution involves helping students to better regulate their learning through the use of effective learning techniques. Fortunately, cognitive and educational psychologists have been developing and evaluating easy-to-use learning techniques that could help students achieve their learning goals. In this monograph, we discuss 10 learning techniques in detail and offer recommendations about their relative utility. We selected techniques that were expected to be relatively easy to use and hence could be adopted by many students. Also, some techniques (e.g., highlighting and rereading) were selected because students report relying heavily on them, which makes it especially important to examine how well they work. The techniques include elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, summarization, highlighting (or underlining), the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text learning, rereading, practice testing, distributed practice, and interleaved practice. To offer recommendations about the relative utility of these techniques, we evaluated whether their benefits generalize across four categories of variables: learning conditions, student characteristics, materials, and criterion tasks. Learning conditions include aspects of the learning environment in which the technique is implemented, such as whether a student studies alone or with a group. Student characteristics include variables such as age, ability, and level of prior knowledge. Materials vary from simple concepts to mathematical problems to complicated science texts. Criterion tasks include different outcome measures that are relevant to student achievement, such as those tapping memory, problem solving, and comprehension. We attempted to provide thorough reviews for each technique, so this monograph is rather lengthy. However, we also wrote the monograph in a modular fashion, so it is easy to use. In particular, each review is divided into the following sections: 1. General description of the technique and why it should work 2. How general are the effects of this technique? 2a. Learning conditions 2b. Student characteristics 2c. Materials 2d. Criterion tasks 3. Effects in representative educational contexts 4. Issues for implementation 5. Overall assessment The review for each technique can be read independently of the others, and particular variables of interest can be easily compared across techniques. To foreshadow our final recommendations, the techniques vary widely with respect to their generalizability and promise for improving student learning. Practice testing and distributed practice received high utility assessments because they benefit learners of different ages and abilities and have been shown to boost students' performance across many criterion tasks and even in educational contexts. Elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, and interleaved practice received moderate utility assessments. The benefits of these techniques do generalize across some variables, yet despite their promise, they fell short of a high utility assessment because the evidence for their efficacy is limited. For instance, elaborative interrogation and self-explanation have not been adequately evaluated in educational contexts, and the benefits of interleaving have just begun to be systematically explored, so the ultimate effectiveness of these techniques is currently unknown. Nevertheless, the techniques that received moderate-utility ratings show enough promise for us to recommend their use in appropriate situations, which we describe in detail within the review of each technique. Five techniques received a low utility assessment: summarization, highlighting, the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text learning, and rereading. These techniques were rated as low utility for numerous reasons. Summarization and imagery use for text learning have been shown to help some students on some criterion tasks, yet the conditions under which these techniques produce benefits are limited, and much research is still needed to fully explore their overall effectiveness. The keyword mnemonic is difficult to implement in some contexts, and it appears to benefit students for a limited number of materials and for short retention intervals. Most students report rereading and highlighting, yet these techniques do not consistently boost students' performance, so other techniques should be used in their place (e.g., practice testing instead of rereading). Our hope is that this monograph will foster improvements in student learning, not only by showcasing which learning techniques are likely to have the most generalizable effects but also by encouraging researchers to continue investigating the most promising techniques. Accordingly, in our closing remarks, we discuss some issues for how these techniques could be implemented by teachers and students, and we highlight directions for future research. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {The irruption of gas and oil into the Gulf of Mexico during the Deepwater Horizon event fed a deep sea bacterial bloom that consumed hydrocarbons in the affected waters, formed a regional oxygen anomaly, and altered the microbiology of the region. In this work, we develop a coupled physical-metabolic model to assess the impact of mixing processes on these deep ocean bacterial communities and their capacity for hydrocarbon and oxygen use. We find that observed biodegradation patterns are well-described by exponential growth of bacteria from seed populations present at low abundance and that current oscillation and mixing processes played a critical role in distributing hydrocarbons and associated bacterial blooms within the northeast Gulf of Mexico. Mixing processes also accelerated hydrocarbon degradation through an autoinoculation effect, where water masses, in which the hydrocarbon irruption had caused blooms, later returned to the spill site with hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria persisting at elevated abundance. Interestingly, although the initial irruption of hydrocarbons fed successive blooms of different bacterial types, subsequent irruptions promoted consistency in the structure of the bacterial community. These results highlight an impact of mixing and circulation processes on biodegradation activity of bacteria during the Deepwater Horizon event and suggest an important role for mixing processes in the microbial ecology of deep ocean environments.},

abstract = {A majority of methods from dynamical system analysis, especially those in applied settings, rely on Poincaré's geometric picture that focuses on "dynamics of states." While this picture has fueled our field for a century, it has shown difficulties in handling high-dimensional, ill-described, and uncertain systems, which are more and more common in engineered systems design and analysis of "big data" measurements. This overview article presents an alternative framework for dynamical systems, based on the "dynamics of observables" picture. The central object is the Koopman operator: an infinite-dimensional, linear operator that is nonetheless capable of capturing the full nonlinear dynamics. The first goal of this paper is to make it clear how methods that appeared in different papers and contexts all relate to each other through spectral properties of the Koopman operator. The second goal is to present these methods in a concise manner in an effort to make the framework accessible to researchers who would like to apply them, but also, expand and improve them. Finally, we aim to provide a road map through the literature where each of the topics was described in detail. We describe three main concepts: Koopman mode analysis, Koopman eigenquotients, and continuous indicators of ergodicity. For each concept, we provide a summary of theoretical concepts required to define and study them, numerical methods that have been developed for their analysis, and, when possible, applications that made use of them. The Koopman framework is showing potential for crossing over from academic and theoretical use to industrial practice. Therefore, the paper highlights its strengths in applied and numerical contexts. Additionally, we point out areas where an additional research push is needed before the approach is adopted as an off-the-shelf framework for analysis and design.},

abstract = {This article reviews theory and applications of Koopman modes in fluid mechanics. Koopman mode decomposition is based on the surprising fact, discovered in Mezi{\'{c}} (2005), that normal modes of linear oscillations have their natural analogsKoopman modesin the context of nonlinear dynamics. To pursue this analogy, one must change the representation of the system from the state-space representation to the dynamics governed by the linear Koopman operator on an infinite-dimensional space of observables. Whereas Koopman in his original paper dealt only with measure-preserving transformations, the discussion here is predominantly on dissipative systems arising from Navier-Stokes evolution. The analysis is based on spectral properties of the Koopman operator. Aspects of point and continuous parts of the spectrum are discussed. The point spectrum corresponds to isolated frequencies of oscillation present in the fluid flow, and also to growth rates of stable and unstable modes. The continuous part of the spectrum corresponds to chaotic motion on the attractor. A method of computation of the spectrum and the associated Koopman modes is discussed in terms of generalized Laplace analysis. When applied to a generic observable, this method uncovers the full point spectrum. A computational alternative is given by Arnoldi-type methods, leading to so-called dynamic mode decomposition, and I discuss the connection and differences between these two methods. A number of applications are reviewed in which decompositions of this type have been pursued. Koopman mode theory unifies and provides a rigorous background for a number of different concepts that have been advanced in fluid mechanics, including global mode analysis, triple decomposition, and dynamic mode decomposition.},

abstract = {Lagrangian transport characteristics in the Gulf of La Spezia, a 5 × 10-km area along the western coast of Italy, are investigated using data collected from a very high frequency (VHF) radar system with 250 m and 30-min resolution and two clusters of Coastal Dynamics Experiment surface drifters during 2 weeks in the summer of 2007. The surface drifters are found to follow the temporal and spatial evolution of the finite-scale Lyapunov exponents (FSLEs) computed by the VHF radar, indicating the precision of both the radar measurements and the diagnostic FSLE in mapping accurately the transport pathways. In light of this agreement, an analysis of the relative dispersion is conducted. It is found that the average FSLE value varies within a narrow range of 4 day-1 ≤ $\lambda$ ≤ 7 day-1 and displays an exponential regime over the entire extent of the measurements. The dynamical implication is that relative dispersion is controlled nonlocally, namely by slow, persistent, energetic mesoscale structures as opposed to the rapidly evolving high-gradient small-scale turbulent features. The value of the exponent is about an order of magnitude larger than those found in previous modeling studies and analysis of SCULP data in the Gulf of Mexico but somewhat smaller than that estimated from CLIMODE drifters in the Gulf Stream region. Scaling of the FSLE using a metric of resolved gradients of the Eulerian fields in the form of a positive Okubo-Weiss criterion is useful, but not as precise as in modeling studies. The horizontal flow convergence is found to have a small yet tangible effect on relative dispersion. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

The conventional methods to acquire the actual patterns are to measure it, by either a transponder or a monotone beacon borne on a ship moving through all the look angles, leading to increased system complexity and cost. To address this, a novel method for automatic antenna pattern estimation is proposed, which is only involved with some soft computations, i.e. recursively approaching the actual patterns by the amplitude and direction parameter pairs extracted from the single-DOA sea echoes. Both simulations and real radar data processing results show the validity of the proposed method. {\textcopyright} 2012 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

Such quotients are formed in the extraction of sea-state parameters from high-frequency (HF) radar Doppler spectra. An equivalent chi-squared process is shown to represent a spectral integration having a varying mean based on central-limit theorem arguments. The error of estimating the centroid of a spectral peak is derived and shown to depend only on the total length of the time series, not on how it is segmented into coherent spectra and incoherent averages. Finally, error in estimation of waveheight using a power-law relationship is analyzed and is seen to depend on how one does the averaging. When individual spectra contain varying path losses and/or system gains, averages of quotients for each spectrum remove such unknown factors; in this case spectra with greater frequency resolution lead to lower waveheight estimation errors.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of estimating signal parameters using an array of sensors. This problem is of interest in a variety of applications, such as radar and sonar source localization. A vast number of estimation techniques have been proposed in the literature during the past two decades. Most of these can deliver consistent estimates only if the covariance matrix of the background noise is known. In many applications, the aforementioned assumption is unrealistic. Recently, a number of contributions have addressed the problem of signal parameter estimation in unknown noise environments based on various assumptions on the noise. Herein, a different approach is taken. We assume instead that the signals are partially known. The received signals are modeled as linear combinations of certain known basis functions. The exact maximum likelihood (ML) estimator for the problem at hand is derived, as well as computationally more attractive approximation. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB) on the estimation error variance is also derived and found to coincide with the CRB, assuming an arbitrary deterministic model and known noise covariance},

abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating directions of arrival (DOAs) of multiple sources observed on the background of nonuniform white noise with an arbitrary diagonal covariance matrix. A new deterministic maximum likelihood (ML) DOA estimator is derived. Its implementation is based on an iterative procedure which includes a stepwise concentration of the log-likelihood (LL) function with respect to the signal and noise nuisance parameters and requires only a few iterations to converge. New closed-form expressions for the deterministic and stochastic direction estimation Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) are derived for the considered nonuniform model. Our expressions can be viewed as an extension of the well-known results by Stoica and Nehorai (1989, 1990) and Weiss and Friedlander (1993) to a more general noise model than the commonly used uniform one. In addition, these expressions extend the results obtained by Matveyev et al. (see Circuits, Syst., Signal Process., vol.18, p.479-87, 1999) to the multiple source case. Comparisons with the above-mentioned earlier results help to discover several interesting properties of DOA estimation in the nonuniform noise case. To compare the estimation performance of the proposed ML technique with the results of our CRB analysis and with the performance of conventional {\&}ldquo;uniform{\&}rdquo; ML, simulation results are presented. Additionally, we test our technique using experimental seismic array data.

abstract = {Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in unknown noise environments is an important but challenging problem. Several methods based on maximum likelihood (ML) criteria and parameterization of signals or noise covariances have been established. Generally, to obtain the exact ML (EML) solutions, the DOAs must be jointly estimated along with other noise or signal parameters by optimizing a complicated nonlinear function over a high-dimensional problem space. Although the computation complexity can be reduced via derivation of suboptimal approximate ML (AML) functions using large sample assumption or least square criteria, nevertheless the AML estimators still require multi-dimensional search and the accuracy is lost to some extent. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) based solution is proposed here to compute the EML functions and explore the potential superior performances. A key characteristic of PSO is that the algorithm itself is highly robust yet remarkably simple to implement, while processing similar capabilities as other evolutionary algorithms such as the genetic algorithm (GA). Simulation results confirm the advantage of paring PSO with EML, and the PSO-EML estimator is shown to significantly outperform AML-based techniques in various scenarios at less computational costs.},

By introducing a pre-whitening procedure in multiple signal classification (MUSIC), the resolution performance of MUSIC is enhanced in spatially colored noise environment. Results with data from the aircraft detecting experiment conducted by the Research Institute of Electronic Engineering of Harbin Institute of Technology in 1994 and simulated data of two targets show that pre-whitened MUSIC can provide a better resolution and accurate determination of target number.

abstract = {The main contribution of our work consists in developing for the first time a method of estimating the direction of arrival (DOA) parameters assuming noncircular and temporally and spatially correlated signals. This new approach, based on a significant enhancement of the two-sided instrumental variable signal subspace fitting (IV-SSF) method, outperforms its classical version in terms of lower bias and error variance. Moreover, it will be shown that our new method is statistically more efficient than the MODE method especially in the case of partly and fully coherent signals where only the extended and the classical two-sided IV-SSF methods are applicable. We also derive an explicit expression for the stochastic Cram{\&}{\#}x00E9;r{\&}{\#}x2013;Rao bound (CRB) of the DOA estimates from temporally and spatially correlated signals generated from noncircular sources. The new CRB is compared to those of circular temporally correlated and noncircular independent and identically distributed signals to show that the CRB obtained assuming both noncircular sources and temporally correlated signals is lower than the CRBs derived considering only one of these two assumptions. This illustrates the potential gain that both noncircularity and temporal correlation provide when considered together. It will also be proven that the difference between the three CRBs increases with the number of snapshots. However, as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases, the CRBs merge together and decrease linearly. Moreover, at low SNR values it will be shown that temporal correlation is more informative about the unknown DOA parameters than noncircularity. Finally, the CRB derived assuming noncircular and temporally correlated signals depends on the noncircularity rate, the circularity phase separation, and the DOA separation.},

In experiments, the nonstationary GP regression model per- forms well when the input space is two or three dimensions, outperform- ing a neural network model and Bayesian free-knot spline models, and competitive with a Bayesian neural network, but is outperformed in one dimension by a state-of-the-art Bayesian free-knot spline model.

abstract = {At grazing, propagation and scatter become inex- tricably connected. For sufficiently low source/observer heights, free-space inverse-distance propagation no longer applies and plane-wave descriptions of scatter give way to surface-wave modes. Concepts like surface radar cross section must be re- interpreted; lack of awareness of these facts in attempts to correlate measurements with grazing-angle laws has led to con- tradictions. When plane-wave depictions hold, a regime is entered where backscatter follows a grazing angle-to-the-fourth power dependence for surfaces of any roughness scales for both po- larizations and for perfectly conducting as well as impedance boundaries above penetrable media. Propagation is described in terms of a roughness-modified effective impedance/admittance that approaches a constant at grazing for all roughness profiles. These facts are first explored with numerical examples, after which we establish universal laws that confirm these suspicions. We derive expressions for the first Taylor-series expansion terms for scatter and impedance/admittance versus grazing angle. Sta- tistics are neither required nor excluded—the laws hold for single arbitrary deterministic profiles as well as averages over ensembles of random surface samples. Proofs of these claims are based on two-dimensional (2-D) fields over one-dimensional (1-D) impedance/admittance boundaries.},

abstract = {An HF radar called the Coastal Ocean Dynamics Applications Radar (CODAR) is presently being used in several forms to measure ocean surface parameters. The original version was developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and utilizes a four-element receive array. The array consists of four equally spaced elements arranged on a circle with a radius of 0.2151 wavelengths (at 25.4 MHz). It was designed to measure ocean currents using a direction-finding technique based on an extension to a simple two-element interferometer.  The problem of determining the bearing of a radiating source can be readily shown to be equivalent to that incurred in spectral estimation. In an attempt to improve upon the processing of existing data, modern nonlinear spectral estimation techniques are applied in a beam-forming bearing estimation procedure and compared against several direction-finding algorithms. Enhancement of bearing estimators via analysis of the eigenstructure of a spatial correlation matrix is included. Antenna response patterns are calculated and used to investigate properties of direction-finding algorithms. Simulated data are used for a comparison of direction finding and beam forming. The asymmetrical bias of each method is investigated to determine its effect on the error in estimating the angle of arrival of a radar target. ER  -},

abstract = {The increase of salt intrusion in recent years in the Modaomen Estuary, one of the estuaries of the Pearl River Delta in China, has threatened the freshwater supply in the surrounding regions, especially the cities of Zhongshan, Zhuhai in Guangdong Province and Macau. A numerical modeling system using nested grids was developed to investigate the salt transport mechanisms and the response of salt intrusion to changes in river discharge and tidal mixing. The steady shear transport induced by estuarine circulation reaches maximum and minimum, respectively, during neap and spring tides, while the tidal oscillatory transport shows an opposite pattern. The net transport is landward during neap tides and seaward during spring tides. The salt intrusion length responding to constant river discharges generally follows a power law of -0.49. The dependence of salt intrusion on tidal velocity is less than that predicted by theoretical models for exchange flow dominated estuaries. The response of salt intrusion to change in tidal velocity depends largely on river discharge. When river flow increases, the impact of tidal velocity increases and the phase lag of response time decreases. The asymmetries of salt intrusion responding to increasing and decreasing river discharge (tidal velocity) are observed in the estuary. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The surface buoyancy gradients and ageostrophic secondary circulations intensify in response to the mesoscale strain field as predicted by the theory of filamentogenesis. It can be understood in terms of a dual frontogenetic process, along the lines understood for a single front. There is, however, a stronger secondary circulation due to the amplification at the center of a cold filament. Filament dynamics in the presence of a mixed layer are not adequately described by the classical thermal wind balance. The effect of vertical mixing of momentum due to turbulence in the surface layer is of the same order of magnitude as the pressure gradient and Coriolis force and contributes equally to a so-called turbulent therm...},

abstract = {One type of phased-array radar of current interest employs an array of separate receiving elements, each followed by an individual amplifier. These individual signals are combined coherently to form one or more receiving beams for searching, tracking, or performing both functions simultaneously. This paper presents an approach to the theory of angle measurement with a phased array of this type. In the one-dimensional problem considered here, the receiving antenna consists of a linear array of individual antenna-amplifier elements. The receiver-noise-limited case is considered, in which accuracy is limited by the additive normally distributed noise present in each channel. An expression is derived for the limiting accuracy of angular measurement when a single set of samples is available. This set of samples is obtained simultaneously, one sample from each channel. Next, two methods of implementing the angular measurements are discussed. These are amplitude comparison monopulse and a coherent or phase comparison technique. For large signal-to-noise ratios and for either a square law or a linear envelope detector, the accuracy of amplitude comparison monopulse approaches the theoretical limit. The same accuracy can be achieved with the coherent technique by proper weighting of the individual signals.},

abstract = {In this work, the benefits of high-frequency (HF) radar ocean observation technology for backtracking drift- ing objects are analysed. The HF radar performance is evaluated by comparison of trajectories between drifter buoys versus numerical simulations using a Lagrangian trajectory model. High-resolution currents measured by a coastal HF radar network combined with atmospheric fields provided by numerical models are used to backtrack the trajectory of two dataset of surface-drifting buoys: group I (with drogue) and group II (without drogue). A methodolo- gy based on optimization methods is applied to estimate the uncertainty in the trajectory simulations and to optimize the search area of the backtracked positions. The results show that, to backtrack the trajectory of the buoys in group II, both currents and wind fields were required. However, wind fields could be practically discarded when simulating the trajectories of group I. In this case, the optimal backtracked trajectories were obtained using only HF radar currents as forcing. Based on the radar availability data, two periods ranging between 8 and 10 h were selected to backtrack the buoy trajectories. The root mean squared error (RMSE) was found to be 1.01 km for group I and 0.82 km for group II. Taking into account these values, a search area was calcu- lated using circles of RMSE radii, obtaining 3.2 and 2.11 km2 for groups I and II, respectively. These results show the positive contribution of HF radar currents for backtracking drifting objects and demonstrate that these data combined with atmospheric models are of value to perform backtracking analysis of drifting objects.},

abstract = {This paper presents examples of the data quality assessment of surface radial velocity maps obtained from shore-based single and multiple high-frequency radars (HFRs) using statistical and dynamical approaches in a hindcast mode. Since a single radial velocity map contains partial information regarding a true current field, archived radial velocity data embed geophysical signals, such as tides, wind stress, and near-inertial and low-frequency variance. The spatial consistency of the geophysical signals and their dynamic relationships with driving forces are used to conduct the quality assurance and quality control of radial velocity data. For instance, spatial coherence, tidal amplitudes and phases, and wind-radial transfer functions are used to identify a spurious range and azimuthal bin. The uncertainty and signal-to-noise ratio of radial data are estimated with the standard deviation and cross correlation of paired radials sampled at nearby grid points that belong to two different radars. This review paper can benefit HFR users and operators and those who are interested in analyzing HFR-derived surface radial velocity data. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Data from the Coastal Transition Zone (CTZ) experiment are used to describe the velocity fields and water properties associated with cold filaments in the California Current. Combined with previous field surveys and satellite imagery, these show seasonal variability with maximum dynamic height ranges and velocities in summer and minimum values in late winter and early spring. North of Point Arena (between 39 ¬∞N and 42 ¬∞N) in spring - summer the flow field on the outer edge of the cold water has the character of a meandering jet, carrying fresh, nutrient-poor water from farther north on its offshore side and cold, salty, nutrient-rich water on its inshore side. At Point Arena in midsummer, the jet often flows offshore and continues south without meandering back onshore as strongly as it does farther north. The flow field south of Point Arena in summer takes on more of the character of a field of mesoscale eddies, although the meandering jet from the north continues to be identifiable. The conceptual model for the May - July period between 36 ¬∞N and 42 ¬∞N is thus of a surface jet that meanders through and interacts with a field of eddies; the eddies are more dominant south of 39 ¬∞N, where the jet broadens and where multiple jets and filaments are often present. At the surface, the jet often separates biological communities and may appear as a barrier to cross-jet transport, especially north of Point Arena early in the season (March - May). However, phytoplankton pigment and nutrients are carried on the inshore flank of the jet, and pigment maxima are sometimes found in the core of the jet. The biological effect of the jet is to define a convoluted, 100 to 400-km-wide region next to the coast, within which much of the richer water is contained, and also to carry some of that richer water offshore in meanders along the outer edge of that region. ¬{\textcopyright} American Geophysical Union 1991},

Here we propose a dynamical explanation by the process of filamentary intensification that shrinks the transverse scale of rectilinear surface temperature extrema at a super-exponential rate by the action of horizontal deformation flows associated with mesoscale eddies. This process is analogous to deformation-induced frontogenesis with sharpening temperature gradients accelerated by its ageostrophic secondary circulation. In the particular case of cold filaments, the shrinking rate, surface convergence, and downwelling are especially strong because of the configuration of ageostrophic acceleration. This behavior is demonstrated theoretically with idealized two-dimensional solutions and illustrated in a realistic regional circulation simulation near Peru.},

abstract = {High-Frequency (HF) radars are operated in the 3-30 MHz frequency band. For oceanographic applications low transmit power HF radar systems have been developed, which use surface electromagnetic wave propagation along the salty ocean surface. The WERA HF radar system transmits a power of 30 watts but achieves detection ranges up to 200 km, which are far beyond the conventional microwave radar coverage. Hence the radar system can be used for coastal monitoring. Due to external noise, radio frequency interference, and sea clutter the radar detection capability is limited. Real measured radar data from the WERA system were recorded for a 12-hour period. The measured radar data were correlated with simultaneously available Automatic Identification System (AIS) information, which shows current ship position, speed, course and type. This paper presents statistical analysis of maximum detectable range and target reflectivity to estimate the radar performance in case of different cargo ship sizes. Based on the order-statistic constant false alarm rate (OS-CFAR) detection rule the potentially detectable target range and aspect angle of different ship categories were analyzed.},

abstract = {The data from two high-frequency radars (HFR) operating in the Iroise Sea are re-processed by applying an improved version of the direction finding algorithm, removing wave-induced surface currents and the variational interpolation on a regular grid. Combining these processing techniques allowed reconstruction of the surface currents at a level of details that was not previously available. Refined resolution enabled to identify fine-scale structures of surface circulation, to quantify the variability of tidal currents and the residual (time averaged) velocity field, and to explain spatial intermittence in polarization of the tidal current ellipses. The analyzed data span two month-long periods in spring and late summer of 2007. The major findings include (a) a dipole structure in the vorticity field characterized by two oppositely rotating eddies, generated on the leeward side of the Ushant Island at flood (negative polarity) and at ebb (positive polarity); (b) an extremely strong fortnightly variability of tidal currents northwest of the Ushant Island with the highest velocity magnitude of 3.9. m/s caused by the interference of the major semi-diurnal tidal constituents; (c) a significant contribution of the higher order nonlinear tidal harmonics to the surface currents in the Fromveur strait, which maintains strong tidal currents and affects the shape of their fortnightly modulation. The residual circulation is characterized by two distinct zones approximately separated by the 100. m isobath: in the offshore zone the residual currents have a significant contribution of the wind-driven component, whereas the nearshore zone is characterized by extremely strong (up to 0.4. m/s) time-independent residual circulation featuring two permanent anticyclonic eddies: north of the western extremity of the Sein archipelago, and north the Ushant Island. The acquired data and the presented results could be useful for regional model validation and studies of the local eddy dynamics, tidal fronts, and passive tracer transport in the region. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Uncertainty estimates on particle position, D(t), are computed and compared to absolute dispersion, D0(t), that provides an indication of the uncertainty in case of zero prior knowledge. In agreement with previous studies, radar results show that D(t)???1/2D0(t) (i.e. ???6km after 24h). Model results are less reliable, as it can be expected in highly nonlinear coastal flows without local data assimilation. The central result of this paper is that when drifters are promptly deployed in an area of interest, their data can be used to significantly improve transport estimates using the Lagrangian blending algorithm LAVA with velocity fields from models or radar. Uncertainty can be reduced to ???1/6D0(t), (i.e. ???2km after 24h) for both radar and model, implying a much reduced search range in case of operational applications. The method is also found to have some forecasting skills with uncertainty ???1/2D0(t) during the first ???6h. Sensitivity tests provide indications on relevant time and space scales of predictability and provide suggestions for appropriate drifter sampling strategies.},

abstract = {The surface current response to winds is analyzed in a 2-yr time series of a 12-MHz (HF) Wellen Radar (WERA) off the west coast of France. Consistent with previous observations, the measured currents, after filtering tides, are on the order of 1.0{\%}–1.8{\%} of the wind speed, in a direction 10°–40° to the right of the wind, and with systematic trends as a function of wind speed. This Lagrangian current can be decomposed as the vector sum of a quasi-Eulerian current UE, representative of the top 1 m of the water column and part of the wave-induced Stokes drift Uss at the sea surface. Here, Uss is estimated with an accurate numerical wave model using a novel parameterization of wave dissipation processes. Using both observed and modeled wave spectra, Uss is found to be very well approximated by a simple function of the wind speed and significant wave height, generally increasing quadratically with the wind speed. Focusing on a site located 100 km from the mainland, the wave-induced contribution of Uss to the radar measurement has an estimated magnitude of 0.6{\%}–1.3{\%} of the wind speed, in the wind direction—a percentage that increases with wind speed. The difference UE of Lagrangian and Stokes contributions is found to be on the order of 0.4{\%}–0.8{\%} of the wind speed and 45°–70° to the right of the wind. This relatively weak, quasi-Eulerian current with a large deflection angle is interpreted as evidence of strong near-surface mixing, likely related to breaking waves and/or Langmuir circulations. Summer stratification tends to increase the UE response by up to a factor of 2 on average, and further increase the deflection angle of UE by 5°–10°. At locations closer to the coast, Uss is smaller and UE is larger with a smaller deflection angle. These results would be transposable to the World Ocean if the relative part of geostrophic currents in UE was weak, which is expected. This decomposition into Stokes drift and quasi-Eulerian current is most important for the estimation of energy fluxes to the Ekman layer.},

abstract = {High-frequency radars measure projections of surface velocity vectors on the directions of the radar beams. A variational method for reconstruction of the 2d velocity field from such observations is proposed. The interpolation problem is regularized by penalizing high-frequency variability of the surface vorticity and divergence fields. Twin-data experiments are used to assess the method's skill and compare it with two well-known approaches to HFR data processing: conventional local interpolation and more sophisticated non-local scheme known as open-boundary modal analysis (OMA). It is shown that the variational method and OMA have a significant advantage over local interpolation because of their ability to reconstruct the velocity field within the gaps in data coverage, near the coastlines and in the areas covered only by one radar. Compared to OMA, the proposed variational method appears to be more flexible in processing gappy observations and more accurate at noise levels below 30{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A dual-station high-frequency (HF) Wellen Radar (WERA) transmitting at 16MHz has observed nearreal-time surface currents over an approximate range of 100km across the Florida Straits since July 2004. During a 10-day period in April 2005 (15-25 April), a pair of 12.6-MHz SeaSondes (SS) were deployed south of the WERAs sites by NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS). The resulting SS grid overlapped the southern portion of theWERAdomain. During the same period of time, a bottom-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) acquired subsurface current measurements within these HF radar grids starting at 14m below the surface in water of 86-m depth. The interoperability of beam-forming (WERA) and direction-finding (SS) HF radar technologies was examined. Comparisons of radial and vector currents for an 8-day concurrent time series suggested good agreement in current direction over both domains, where the surface currents' magnitudes were a maximum of 1.2ms-1. In the core of the radar domains consisting of 108 cells, hourly vector currents were obtained by combining WERA and SS radials. Generally, this can be done in a relatively straightforward manner, considering the geometric dilution of precision (GDOP). A second key issue is downscaling the SS measurements from a 3-km grid to a 1.1-km grid to match the WERA output. This enhanced grid spacing is important along the western flank of the Florida Current, where energetic, small-scale surface features have been observed. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

This paper describes the OSMAR2000 ocean surface current algorithm based on MUSIC and the validation experiments in the East China Sea.

abstract = {Scatter from the sea near grazing from MF through VHF is analyzed in this paper. Results based on the compensation theorem show that the dependence upon the grazing angles, as well as upon frequency, range, and the effective surface impedance, can be removed for vertical polarization as the familiar ''Norton attenuation factors.'' Time variation of the surface is included, and results are derived for both the average received power and its spectral density. The first-order dispersion relationship for gravity waves is used to show that the received spectrum from a patch of sea consists of two discrete Doppler shifts above and below the carrier, predictable from simple Bragg diffraction considerations. Using the Phillips wind-wave model as an upper limit for wave heights, estimates sigma0 (radar cross section per unit area) of -17 dB are obtained near grazing. Both the magnitude of sigmavv0 predicted from theory and the nature of the received spectrum are compared with measurements and the agreement supports the theory on both counts. Finally, the use of MF/HF radars for measuring sea state is suggested and discussed.},

In the US Navy, these surface current maps are being evaluated for operational use in real-time data assimilating coastal circulation models, and direct monitoring tools in environmentally sensitive operating areas. The SeaSonde HF radar, a DF system, was considered in this study.  It uses the MUSIC algorithm to recover bearings from the Doppler backscatter spectrum of the sea surface.  By varying the radial and antenna patterns, the simulated backscatter spectra were passed through the SeaSonde software suite for radial pattern recovery.  This unprecedented approach directly evaluated SeaSonde's MUSIC, and the associated uncertainties were examined against the simulated inputs of (1) fixed amplitude and phase deviations from the ideal antenna pattern, (2) measured antenna patterns and (3) decreasing SNR. It was found that using the measured antenna pattern to recover radials yielded least uncertainty, but a definitive prediction of MUSIC's radial-recovery capability in relation to the pattern's complex amplitude and phase structure remained illusive.  The results highlighted the need to calibrate the military's DF-systems for accurate azimuth recovery.},

abstract = {A simulation-based investigation of errors in HF radarderived, near-surface ocean current measurements is presented. The simulation model is specific to Coastal Ocean Dynamics Application Radar (CODAR) SeaSonde radar systems that employ a compact, collocated antenna geometry. In this study, radial current retrievals are obtained by processing simulated data using unmodified CODAR data processing software. To avoid limiting the results to specific ocean current and wind wave scenarios, the analyses employ large ensembles of randomly varying simulated environmental conditions. The effect of antenna pattern distortion on the accuracy of retrievals is investigated using 40 different antenna sensitivity patterns of varying levels of distortion. A single parameter is derived to describe the level of the antenna pattern distortion. This parameter is found to be highly correlated with the rms error of the simulated radial currents (r 5 0.94) and therefore can be used as a basis for evaluating the severity of site-specific antenna pattern distortions. Ensemble averages of the subperiod simulated current retrieval standard deviations are found to be highly correlated with the antenna pattern distortion parameter (r 5 0.92). Simulations without distortions of the antenna pattern indicate that an rms radial current error of 2.9 cm s21 is a minimum bound on the error of a SeaSonde ocean radar system, given a typical set of operating parameters and a generalized ensemble of ocean conditions.},

abstract = {A technique for reconstruction of the 2d surface velocity field from radar observations is proposed. The method consecutively employs two processing techniques: At the first stage raw radial velocity data are subject to EOF analysis, which enables to fill gaps in observations and provides estimates of the noise level and integral parameters characterizing small-scale variability of the sea surface circulation. These parameters are utilized at the second stage, when the cost function for variational interpolation is constructed, and the updated radial velocities are interpolated on the regular grid. Experiments with simulated and real data are used to assess the method's skill and compare it with the conventional 2d variational (2dVar) approach. It is shown that the proposed technique consistently improves performance of the 2dVar algorithm and becomes particularly effective when a radar stops operating for 1-2 days and/or a persistent gap emerges in spatial coverage of a basin by the HFR network. ?? 2011.},

abstract = {In eigenstructure methods for direction of arrival estimation of signal wavefronts, the additive noise is assumed to be spatially white, i.e., of equal power and uncorrelated from sensor to sensor. When the noise is nonwhite but has a known covariance, we can still handle the problem through prewhitening. However, there are no techniques presently available to deal with completely unknown noise fields. In this paper, we propose a solution to this unknown noise covariance problem for the case when the noise field is invariant under two measurements of the array covariance; situations where this assumption is valid are not uncommon in sonar applications. In fact, the idea has been used in certain so-called "despoking" algorithms for conventional beamformers. Results of computer simulations carried out to compare the performance of the new algorithm to earlier methods are also presented.},

abstract = {Most array processing algorithms are based on the assumption that the signals are generated by point sources, This is a mathematical constraint that is not satisfied in many applications. In this paper, we consider situations where the sources are distributed in space with a parametric angular crosscorrelation kernel. We propose an algorithm that estimates the parameters of this model using a generalization of the MUSIC algorithm. The method involves maximizing a cost function that depends on a matrix array manifold and the noise eigenvectors. We study two particular cases: coherent and incoherent spatial source distributions. The spatial correlation function for a uniformly distributed signal is derived. From this, we find the array gain and show that (in contrast to point sources) it does not increase linearly with the number of sources. We compare our method to the conventional (point source) MUSIC algorithm. The simulation studies show that the new method outperforms the MUSIC algorithm by reducing the estimation bias and the standard deviation for scenarios with distributed sources. It is also shown that the threshold signal-to-noise ratio required for resolving two closely spaced distributed sources is considerably smaller for the new method.},

abstract = {The spatio-temporal variability of submesoscale eddies off southern San Diego is investigated with two-year observations of subinertial surface currents [O(1)m depth] derived from shore-based high-frequency radars. The kinematic and dynamic quantities - velocity potential, stream function, divergence, vorticity, and deformation rates - are directly estimated from radial velocity maps using optimal interpolation. For eddy detection, the winding-angle approach based on flow geometry is applied to the calculated stream function. A cluster of nearly enclosed streamlines with persistent vorticity in time is identified as an eddy. About 700 eddies were detected for each rotation (clockwise and counter-clockwise). The two rotations show similar statistics with diameters in the range of 5-25km and Rossby number of 0.2-2. They persist for 1-7 days with weak seasonality and migrate with a translation speed of 4-15cms-1 advected by background currents. The horizontal structure of eddies exhibits nearly symmetric tangential velocity with a maximum at the defined radius of the eddy, non-zero radial velocity due to background flows, and Gaussian vorticity with the highest value at the center. In contrast divergence has no consistent spatial shape. Two episodic events are presented with other in situ data (subsurface current and temperature profiles, and local winds) as an example of frontal-scale secondary circulation associated with drifting submesoscale eddies. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A network of high-frequency (HF) radars is deployed along the New Jersey coast providing synoptic current maps across the entire shelf. These data serve a variety of user groups from scientific research to Coast Guard search and rescue. In addition, model forecasts have been shown to improve with surface current assimilation. In all applications, there is a need for better definitions and assessment of the measurement uncertainty. During a summer coastal predictive skill experiment in 2001, an array of in situ current profilers was deployed near two HF radar sites, one long-range and one standard-range system. Comparison statistics were calculated between different vertical bins on the same current profiler, between different current profilers, and between the current profilers and the different HF radars. The velocity difference in the vertical and horizontal directions were then characterized using the observed root-mean-square (rms) differences. We further focused on two cases, one with relatively high vertical variability, and the second with relatively low vertical variability. Observed differences between the top bin of the current profiler and the HF radar were influenced by both system accuracy and the environment. Using the in situ current profilers, the environmental variability over scales based on the HF radar sampling was quantified. HF radar comparisons with the current profilers were on the same order as the observed environmental difference over the same scales, indicating that the environment has a significant influence on the observed differences. Velocity variability in the vertical and horizontal directions both contribute to these differences. When the potential effects of the vertical variability could be minimized, the remaining difference between the current profiler and the HF radar was similar to the measured horizontal velocity difference ({\~{}}2.5 cm/s) and below the resolution of the raw radial data at the time of the deployment},

Data were collected on May 13th 2008 in the Bay of Brest, France. The data statistical analysis, after beamforming, shows that for near range cells the signal amplitude fits well the Rayleigh distribution, while for far cells the data show a more pronounced heavy-tailed behavior. The causes can be traced in man-made (i.e. radio communications) and/or natural (i.e. reflections of the transmitted signal through the ionosphere layers, meteor trails) interferences.},

The radar system parameters used in the simulation were taken from the University of Michigan's multi-frequency coastal radar (MCR). which operates on four frequencies from 4.8 to 21.8 MHz and employs an eight-clement linear phased array for its receive antenna. Results show MUSIC direction finding to be applicable to phased array systems and to have a better sensitivity to sharp current features, but larger random error than traditional beam forming methods, Also, for cases where beam forming errors are dominated by beam width or low signal to noise ratio, results show MUSIC to be a viable alternative to beam forming.},

abstract = {Since several years, High Frequency (HF) Over-The-Horizon (OTH) radar is used to measure oc{\&}{\#}x00E9;anographie parameters, such as currents, waves, and wind direction over large areas up to 200 km off the coast. Cost effective low power systems transmitting less than 50 Watts have been developed, e.g. the WERA (WEUen RAdar), and are now commercially available. Besides their applications in oceanography within coastal monitoring systems, these systems can also be used to detect and track ships, if they are modified for this functionality. A ship detection and tracking algorithm for HF-radar has been developed at the University of Hamburg (UHH) in cooperation with the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg (TUHH). A first evaluation of this algorithm has been done using a data set acquired at Figueira, Portugal, using an 8 MHz WERA system. In May 2009, the NATO Undersea Research Centre (NURC) initiated a measurement campaign in the Ligurian Sea off La Spezia, Italy, which involved two WERA HF-radar systems operated at 12.5 MHz, one directional waverider and a meteorological buoy. In addition AIS data were recorded and satellite borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images were acquired. This paper presents preliminary results which show the effectiveness of the HF-radar as a long range ({\&}{\#}x223C;130 km) continuous-time coverage surveillance system, despite of its low spatial resolution of 1.5 km. The performance of the HF-radar ship detection and tracking algorithms are evaluated by comparison to AIS and SAR. The detection error found for this data set is less than 1 km for {\&}{\#}x223C;68{\%} of the comparisons between HF-radar and (AIS) reported locations, which is comparable to previous results from the Figueira data set.},

abstract = {Chaotic advection has served as the paradigm for mixing in fluid flows with simple time dependence. Its skeletal structure is based on analysis of invariant attracting and repelling manifolds in fluid flows. Here we develop a finite-time theory for two-dimensional incompressible fluid flows with arbitrary time dependence and introduce a new mixing diagnostic based on it. Besides stretching events around attracting and repelling manifolds, this allows us to detect hyperbolic mixing zones. We used the new diagnostic to forecast the spatial location and timing of oil washing ashore in Plaquemines Parish and Grand Isle, Louisiana, and Pensacola, Florida, in May 2010 and the flow of oil toward Panama City Beach, Florida, in June 2010.},

abstract = {High-frequency (HF) radar technology produces detailed velocity maps near the surface of estuaries and bays. The use of velocity data in environmental prediction, nonetheless, remains unexplored. In this paper, we uncover a striking flow structure in coastal radar observations of Monterey Bay, along the California coastline. This complex structure governs the spread of organic contaminants, such as agricultural runoff which is a typical source of pollution in the bay. We show that a HF radar-based pollution release scheme using this flow structure reduces the impact of pollution on the coastal environment in the bay. We predict the motion of the Lagrangian flow structures from finite-time Lyapunov exponents of the coastal HF velocity data. From this prediction, we obtain optimal release times, at which pollution leaves the bay most efficiently.},

An ensemble simulation of the WFS model is carried out under different wind-forcings in order to estimate the error covariance of the model state vector and the covariance between ocean currents and winds. Radial currents measured by high-frequency radar antennas near Saint Petersburg and Venice, Florida, USA, are assimilated using this ensemble-based error covariance. Different assimilation techniques using a time-average ensemble, a filter to reduce surface-gravity waves and an extended state vector including wind stress were tested.

Since most coastal HF radar observations are made in water shallow compared with the dominant ocean wavelength, that solution has proven inadequate for those applications. This paper derives the more general expression for water of arbitrary depth, and demonstrates its validity against measured data. The hydrodynamic contribution increases in importance as waves of constant energy move into shallow water. The use of these results for interpretation of both narrow-beam and CODAR data is discussed.},

abstract = {This study investigates the applicability of the optimal interpolation (OI) method proposed by Kim et al. for estimating ocean surface currents from high-frequency radar (HFR) in the northeastern Chukchi Sea, where HFR siting is dictated by power availability rather than optimal locations. Although the OI technique improves data coverage when compared to the conventional unweighted least squares fit (UWLS) method, biased solutions can emerge. The quality of the HFR velocity estimates derived by OI is controlled by three factors: 1) the number of available incorporating radials (AR), 2) the ratio of the incorporating radials from multiple contributing site locations [ratio of overlapping radial velocities (ROR) or radar geometry], and 3) the positive definiteness [condition number (CN)] of the correlation matrix. Operationally, ROR does not require knowledge of the angle covariance matrix used to compute the geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) in the UWLS method and can be computed before site selection to optimize coverage or after data processing to assess data quality when applying the OI method. The Kim et al. method is extended to examine sensitivities to data gaps in the radial distribution and the effects on OI estimates. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {The rapid expansion of urbanization along the worlds coastal areas requires a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of the coastal ocean. Over the past several decades, numerical ocean circulation models have tried to provide such insight, based on our developing understanding of physical ocean processes. The systematic establishment of coastal ocean observation systems adopting cutting-edge technology, such as high frequency (HF) radar, satellite sensing, and gliders, has put such ocean model predictions to the test, by providing comprehensive observational datasets for the validation of numerical model forecasts. The New York Harbor Observing and Prediction System (NYHOPS) is a comprehensive system for understanding coastal ocean processes on the continental shelf waters of New York and New Jersey. To increase confidence in the systems ocean circulation predictions in that area, a detailed validation exercise was carried out using HF radar and Lagrangian drifter-derived surface currents from three drifters obtained between March and October 2010. During that period, the root mean square (RMS) differences of both the eastwest and northsouth currents between NYHOPS and HF radar were approximately 15 cm s1. Harmonic analysis of NYHOPS and HF radar surface currents shows similar tidal ellipse parameters for the dominant M2 tide, with a mean difference of 2.4 cm s1 in the semi-major axis and 1.4 cm s1 in the semi-minor axis and 3 in orientation and 10 in phase. Surface currents derived independently from drifters along their trajectories showed that NYHOPS and HF radar yielded similarly accurate results. RMS errors when compared to currents derived along the trajectory of the three drifters were approximately 10 cm s1. Overall, the analysis suggests that NYHOPS and HF radar had similar skill in estimating the currents over the continental shelf waters of the Middle Atlantic Bight during this time period. An ensemble-based set of particle tracking simulations using one drifter which was tracked for 11 days showed that the ensemble mean separation generally increases with time in a linear fashion. The separation distance is not dominated by high frequency or short spatial scale wavelengths suggesting that both the NYHOPS and HF radar currents are representing tidal and inertial time scales correctly and resolving some of the smaller scale eddies. The growing ensemble mean separation distance is dominated by errors in the mean flow causing the drifters to slowly diverge from their observed positions. The separation distance for both HF radar and NYHOPS stays below 30 km after 5 days, and the two technologies have similar tracking skill at the 95 {\%} level. For comparison, the ensemble mean distance of a drifter from its initial release location (persistence assumption) is estimated to be greater than 70 km in 5 days.},

abstract = {Surface waves generated by earthquakes create atmospheric waves detectable in the ionosphere using radio waves techniques: i.e., HF Doppler sounding, GPS and altimeter TEC measurements, as well as radar measurements. We present observations performed with the over-the-horizon (OTH) radar NOSTRADAMUS after the very strong earthquake (M=8.6) that occurred in Sumatra on March 28, 2005. An original method based on the analysis of the RTD (Range-Time-Doppler) image is suggested to identify the multi-chromatic ionospheric signature of the Rayleigh wave. The proposed method presents the advantage to preserve the information on the range variation and time evolution, and provides comprehensive results, as well as easy identification of the waves. In essence, a Burg algorithm of order 1 is proposed to compute the Doppler shift of the radar signal, resulting in sensitivity as good as obtained with higher orders. The multi-chromatic observation of the ionospheric signature of Rayleigh wave allows to extrapolate information coherent with the dispersion curve of Rayleigh waves, that is, we observe two components of the Rayleigh waves with estimated group velocities of 3.8. km/s and 3.6. km/s associated to 28. mHz (T{\~{}}36. s) and 6.1. mHz (T{\~{}}164. s) waves, respectively. Spectral analysis of the RTD image reveals anyway the presence of several oscillations at frequencies between 3 and 8. mHz clearly associated to the transfer of energy from the solid-Earth to the atmosphere, and nominally described by the normal modes theory for a complete planet with atmosphere. Oscillations at frequencies larger than 8. mHz are also observed in the spectrum but with smaller amplitudes. Particular attention is pointed out to normal modes 0S29 and 0S37 which are strongly involved in the coupling process. As the proposed method is frequency free, it could be used not only for detection of ionospheric perturbations induced by earthquakes, but also by other natural phenomena as well as volcanic explosions and particularly tsunamis, for future oceanic monitoring and tsunami warning systems. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = { This paper presents an overview of ship detection by high-frequency (HF) skywave backscatter over-the-horizon radar (OTHR). Ships have been detected at ranges of 2000 km or more by OTHR that uses sufficient resolution in the radar spatial and Doppler frequency domains. The HF sea-echo Doppler spectrum limits the target signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR), as a function of the ocean wave-height distribution, wind direction, radio frequency, and ship target radial velocity. Maximum sea-clutter spectrum purity, and hence larger SCR, is achieved with the use of stable single-mode ionospheric propagation. Real-time measurement and interpretation of ionospheric propagation features therefore must guide the choice of OTHR operating frequency. Experimental data recorded at the ONR/SR1 Wide Aperture Research Facility (WARF) bistatic OTHR in central California demonstrate reliable ship detection in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. WARF transmits 1-MW average effective radiated power, using a linear frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) waveform, and receives with a 2.55-km broadside array of vertical monopole element pairs. Swept bandwidths as high as 200 kHz have been used. Sufficient spectral resolution is achieved with a coherent integration time (CIT) of 12.8 s. Longer CIT, and autoregressive (AR) spectral analysis techniques such as Marple's algorithm, have been used to improve Doppler resolution.},

abstract = {Accurate short-term prediction of surface currents can improve the efficiency of search-and-rescue operations, oil-spill response, and marine operations. We developed a linear statistical model for predicting surface currents (up to 48 h in the future) based on a short time history of past HF-radar observations (past 48 h) and an optional forecast of surface winds. Our model used empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) to capture spatial correlations in the HF-radar data and used a linear autoregression model to predict the temporal dynamics of the EOF coefficients. We tested the developed statistical model using historical observations of surface currents in Monterey Bay, California. The predicted particle trajectories separated from particles advected with HF-radar data at a rate of 4.4 km/day. The developed model was more accurate than an existing statistical model (drifter separation of 5.5 km/day) and a circulation model (drifter separation of 8.9 km/day). When the wind forecast was not available, the accuracy of our model degraded slightly (drifter separation of 4.9 km/day), but was still better than existing models. We found that the minimal length of the HF-radar data required to train an accurate statistical model was between 1 and 2 years, depending on the accuracy desired. Our evaluation showed that the developed model is accurate, is easier to implement and maintain than existing statistical and circulation models, and can be relocated to other coastal systems of similar complexity that have a sufficient history of HF-radar observations.},

abstract = {The Australian Coastal Ocean radar Network (ACORN) is a monitoring network of HF radars which are being installed around Australia under a National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS). It is a five-year project, at the end of which there will be five pairs of radar stations and one triplet installed and operating, enabled by the central pool of funding for the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) which is a part of NCRIS, and augmented by funding from other sources. At each chosen site there is a pair (or triplet) of radar stations, mounted on the shore, which receive radar echoes from the rough sea. Four of the pairs of radar stations are phased array installations and one pair and the triplet are of the amplitude direction finding genre. The NCRIS strategy is to provide easily accessed data, freely available to researchers in quality controlled archives. The IMOS aim is to produce data which will support research into coastal dynamics and exchange between the open ocean and the continental shelf. In addition to research in coastal oceanography, the data are available for algorithm development and evaluation of new applications for HF ocean radar. There is potential for application of the data to management of coastal marine resources, and in marine safety areas. Real-time maps of surface currents and the prospect of short-term forecasting have the potential to reduce search areas in coastal waters and to make pollution/spill mitigation more effective. With the establishment of HF radar monitoring stations like those in ACORN, there is growing opportunity for researchers around the world to access data from well curated archives to carry out basic research on physical oceanography, or applications research without having direct access to the measuring facility. This feature brings the ACORN HF radars into GEOSS for coastal processes and dynamics.},

abstract = {A UHF RiverSonde radar system was deployed in an intertidal salt marsh during November and De- cember 2005 near Georgetown, South Carolina. The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate radar performance in a coastal plain salt marsh, where the channels are highly sinuous and the flow is dominated by tides. To help evaluate radar performance, an acoustic current profiler was placed in a large subtidal channel located in the field of view of the radar. Comparisons indicated that the radar accurately repro- duced both the magnitude and phasing of the surface current. Spatial coverage was generally good in the channels but much more sporadic over the marsh platform. Temporal coverage in the channel was also good and correlated with wind speed. Reliable measurements were obtained under wind speeds as low as 2–3 ms1, which are common at this site. In addition, some unexpected signals were seen at near zero Doppler shift, which were attributed to the saltwater vegetation Spartina alterniflora, which acted as effective radar targets. However, these signals were uncorrelated and likely can be filtered.},

abstract = {Two RiverSondes were operated simultaneously in close proximity in order to provide a two-dimensional map of river surface velocity. The initial test was carried out at Threemile Slough in central California. The two radars were installed about 135 m apart on the same bank of the channel. Each radar used a 3-yagi antenna array and determined signal directions using direction finding. The slough is approximately 200 m wide, and each radar processed data out to about 300 m, with a range resolution of 15 m and an angular resolution of 1 degree. Overlapping radial vector data from the two radars were combined to produce total current vectors at a grid spacing of 10 m, with updates every 5 minutes. The river flow in the region, which has a maximum velocity of about 0.8 m/s, is tidally driven with flow reversals every 6 hours, and complex flow patterns were seen during flow reversal. The system performed well with minimal mutual interference. The ability to provide continuous, non-contact two-dimensional river surface flow measurements will be useful in several unique settings, such as studies of flow at river junctions where impacts to juvenile fish migration are significant. Additional field experiments are planned this year on the Sacramento River.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional river flow patterns have been measured using a pair of RiverSondes in two experiments in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta system of central California during April and October 2007. An experiment was conducted at Walnut Grove, California in order to explore the use of dual RiverSondes to measure flow patterns at a location which is important in the study of juvenile fish migration. The data available during the first experiment were limited by low wind, so a second experiment was conducted at Threemile Slough where wind conditions and surface turbulence historically have resulted in abundant data. Both experiments included ADCP near-surface velocity measurements from either manned or unmanned boats. Both experiments showed good comparisons between the RiverSonde and ADCP measurements. The flow conditions at both locations are dominated by tidal effects, with partial flow reversal at Walnut Grove and complete flow reversal at Threemile Slough. Both systems showed complex flow patterns during the flow reversals. Quantitative comparisons between the RiverSondes and an ADCP on a manned boat at Walnut Grove showed mean differences of 4.5 cm/s in the u (eastward) and 7.6 cm/s in the v (northward) components, and RMS differences of 14.7 cm/s in the u component and 21.0 cm/s in the v component. Quantitative comparisons between the RiverSondes and ADCPs on autonomous survey vessels at Threemile Slough showed mean differences of 0.007 cm/s in the u component and 0.5 cm/s in the v component, and RMS differences of 7.9 cm/s in the u component and 13.5 cm/s in the v component after obvious outliers were removed.},

abstract = {In north and central California, equatorward winds drive equatorward flows and the upwelling of cold dense water over the shelf during the midspring and summer upwelling season. When the winds temporarily weaken, the upwelling flows between Point Reyes and Point Arena “relax,” becoming strongly poleward over the shelf. Analytical and numerical models are used to describe the effect of alongshore variability of winds, bathymetry, and basin-scale pressure gradients on the strength of upwelling and its relaxation. Alongshore winds weaken to the south of Point Reyes, and the shelf becomes narrower from Point Reyes to Monterey Bay. Both of these lead to reduced upwelling at and to the north of Point Reyes, causing an alongshore gradient of temperature and density on the shelf. These alongshore gradients lead to an along-isobath pressure gradient over the shelf that drive the relaxation flows. A simple analytical model is used to explain the dynamics, magnitude, and structure of the relaxation flows. The modeling also suggests that the depth of origin of the upwelled waters, and thus their temperature, is controlled by the along-isobath pressure gradient that exists over the continental slope. This along-slope pressure gradient is also responsible for the California undercurrent in this region. This pressure gradient is not generated in a model of the Californian coast extending from 32°N to 42°N and integrated for several months, suggesting it is caused by dynamics whose spatial or temporal scales are larger than the Californian coast and/or longer than several months.},

@article{Barrick2008,
abstract = {The year 1978 saw the first of these CMTC meetings, at Newark, DE. At that initial symposium, CODAR was introduced to the current measurement community. The word CODAR had been coined by the author at NOAA two years earlier, to describe a novel HF radar technique that now routinely maps surface currents from hundreds of coastal sites in real time. This presentation describes the CODAR concept and its evolution over the past 30 years. HF radar investigations by this author began in 1967 with large phased array antennas spanning hundreds of meters at the coast. The original operations were done to evaluate its surveillance potential against military targets, including ships. Cost-effectiveness limitations mitigated against the HF radars for military targets. It became immediately obvious, however, that the very strong sea echo could be used to measure currents and monitor sea state. When I joined NOAA in 1972 in order to develop this technology for real-time environmental current mapping, our management and I recognized a major drawback that had to be overcome: the large size and resulting costs of the conventional phased array antennas needed at HF. We solved this by adapting for radar - for the first time - direction-finding (DF) rather than beam forming to measure bearing to the target cell. This allowed highly compact, low-cost portable antennas to replace the impractical phased arrays. We reported the very first current maps from HF radar in a 1977 Science paper done with our NOAA compact-antenna CODAR. Over the next 30 years - both within NOAA and after the inventors left in 1983 to form CODAR Ocean Sensors, Ltd. and commercialize the product - hundreds of comparison studies were done by us and others. These led to a robust technology and varied product line suited for different customers' applications, from great range (200 km) to high resolution suitable for harbors (200 m) and even rivers (5 m). More than 250 SeaSondes have been sold; most operate in real ti-$\backslash$nme. This number constitutes 90{\%} of all HF radars produced by everyone worldwide.},

abstract = {Ocean submesoscale ({\{}{\~{}}{\}}2–20 km) mixing processes play a major role in ocean dynamics, in physical– biological interactions (e.g., in the dispersion of larvae), and in the dispersion of pollutants. In this paper, horizontal mixing on a scale of a few kilometers is investigated, from observations of surface currents, using highly resolved (300 m) high-frequency radar. These results show the complexity of ocean mixing on scales of a few kilometers and the existence of temporary barriers to mixing that can affect the dispersion of biological materials and pollutants. These barriers are narrow [O(100 m)] and can survive for a few days. The existence of these barriers is supported in simultaneous aerial photographs. The barriers observed here may require a new approach to the way horizontal mixing is parameterized in ocean and climate models.},

abstract = {The mid-atlantic regional coastal ocean observing system (MARCOOS) will implement an end-to-end regional ocean data acquisition, management, modeling and product generation system to satisfy user needs as defined by the middle atlantic coastal ocean observing regional association (MACOORA). MARCOOS will leverage extensive existing regional assets to augment federal backbone products in response to the MACOORA regional themes of maritime safety and ecological decision making. Regional products enabled by MARCOOS will in turn support the development of even higher resolution products at the sub-regional level, including supporting local MACOORA needs for Coastal Inundation and Water Quality. Through MARCOOS, regional scale observations from a network of HF-Radars, satellites, glider AUVs, and an array of meteorological stations will feed 4 operational numerical modeling systems. The HF radar network provides near realtime surface current observations along 1000 km of coastline with varying coverage from the coast out to the shelf break. The primary goal is to operate the regional system in a coordinated way to guarantee the delivery of quality ocean current and wave data. In this paper we present MARCOOS with an emphasis on the HF Radar network. Particular attention is placed on the setup, operation, and application of the network. Quality control metrics based on comparisons with coast guard deployed surface drifters (SLDMBs) have a specific focus to quantifying the uncertainty in the HF radar surface current estimates as applied to search and rescue observations. These metrics will be used to ensure that quality data is going to the coast guard and that this information is properly incorporated into existing search planning tools.},

abstract = {Ocean surface currents between Cape Nojima and Hachijo Island have been mapped since fall 2000 using a pair of SeaSonde long-range HF radars. During September 2000 through December 2001, the no large meander (NLM) nearshore (n) and offshore (o) modes were observed. The surface current maps allowed new details to be observed in the structure of these modes and the transitions between them. Two noteworthy phenomena include blocking of the surface currents when the Kuroshio was in an extreme nearshore position behind the Zenisu Ridge and the "Kyucho" pattern when the current retroflexed from the NLMo position. In early 2004, a large meander (LM) developed and was well established in its historical position south of Honshu by August 2004. Subsequently, the LM continued propagating downstream, but stopped when it encountered the Izu Ridge. It then moved back to its original position near 137.5°E, and the process repeated itself. This east-west oscillation resulted in two common positions for the LM south of Sagami Bay: from its more westerly position (LMw, for west) the Kuroshio had a very favorable approach to the deep gap between Miyake Island and the Zenisu Ridge, and the currents were strongly toward the northeast through the region. When the meander moved up against the ridge (LMe, for east), a strong along-ridge current toward the northwest was evident, which turned sharply northeast when it encountered the shallow Zenisu Ridge. The dominant timescale for this within-mode variability was about 30 days. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Bistatic operation is illustrated by application to a bistatic pair: Both remote systems receive backscattered echo, with one remote system in addition receiving bistatic echoes transmitted by the other. The pair produces elliptical velocity components in addition to two sets of radials. Results are compared with drifter measurements and checks performed on internal consistency in the radar results. We show that differences in drifter/radar current velocities are consistent with calculated radar data uncertainties. Elliptical and radial velocity components are demonstrated to be consistent within the data uncertainties. Inclusion of bistatic operation in radar networks can be expected to increase accuracy in derived current velocities and extend the coverage area.},

abstract = {Data-driven constituent transport models (CTM), which take surface current measurements from High Frequency (HF) Radar as input can be applied within the context of real-time environmental monitoring, oceanographic assessment, response to episodic events, as well as search and rescue in surface waters.This paper discusses a numerical method that allows for the evaluation of diffusion coefficients in anisotropic flow fields from surface current measurements using HF Radar. The numerical scheme developed was incorporated into a data-driven CTM and through model error analyses, the effects of using spatially variable transport coefficients on model predictions were examined. The error analyses were performed on the model by varying the cell Reynolds number, Re = f(u,K,$\Delta$x) between 0.15 and 100, where u is the velocity vector within the flow field, K is a diffusivity tensor and $\Delta$x is the computational grid cell size.Two instantaneous releases of conservative material were then modeled, the model being initialized at two different locations within the domain. From the two simulation runs, marked differences in the predicted spatial extent of the conservative material resulting from the spatially varying diffusivity values within the study area were observed. Model predictions in terms of variance or size estimates of a diffusing patch were found to be more affected from using inaccurate diffusivity estimates, and less affected from using inaccurate current measurements. The largest errors occurred at Re {\textgreater} 2 associated with changing diffusivity values, going up to as much as a 25-fold difference in variance estimates at Re = 100. Very little effect on variance estimates due to varying velocity values were observed even at Re {\textgreater} 2. This model was applied within the framework of constituent tracking to Corpus Christi Bay in the Texas Gulf of Mexico region. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {To assess the spatial structures and temporal evolutions of distinct physical processes on the West Florida Shelf, patterns of ocean current variability are extracted from a joint HF radar and ADCP dataset acquired from August to September 2003 using Self-Organizing Map (SOM) analyses. Three separate ocean–atmosphere frequency bands are considered: semidiurnal, diurnal, and subtidal. The currents in the semidiurnal band are relatively homogeneous in space, barotropic, clockwise polarized, and have a neap-spring modulation consistent with semidiurnal tides. The currents in the diurnal band are less homogeneous, more baroclinic, and clockwise polarized, consistent with a combination of diurnal tides and near-inertial oscillations. The currents in the subtidal frequency band are stronger and with more complex patterns consistent with wind and buoyancy forcing. The SOM is shown to be a useful technique for extracting ocean current patterns with dynamically distinctive spatial and temporal structures sampled by HF radar and supporting in situ measurements.

The incorporation of surface wave effects is not only imposing a traditional drag coefficient formulation at the free surface, but also the 3D momentum equations are adjusted to include the impact of the vertically dependent radiation stresses on the currents. Based on the current data from SELFE and wave data from SWAN, the oil spill model utilizes oil particle method to predict the trajectory of individual droplets and the oil concentration. Compared with the observations in Dalian New Port oil spill event, the developed model taking into account wave-current coupling administers to giving better conformity than the one without. The comparisons demonstrates that 3D radiation stress impacts the spill dynamics drastically near the sea surface and along the coastline, while having less impact in deeper water. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The temporal evolution of a flow reversal during upwelling conditions along New Jersey's inner shelf is characterized with shipboard, moored, and remote observations. The flow reversal occurs nearshore in the form of a subsurface jet with maximum velocities exceeding 30 cm/s. The jet is most intense in the thermocline, commences during maximum alongshore wind stress, and has a spin-up time approximately equal to the local inertial period. The jet also has a surface signature apparent in ocean current radar data that shows the jet veering offshore and feeding an upwelling center that drifts southward at 5 cm/s. Moored instrumentation within the upwelling center indicates that cross-shelf transport in the warm surface layer is consistent with the predicted Ekman transport prior to the spin-up of the jet, but exceeds Ekman transport thereafter. However, onshore transport in the lower layer never compensates for offshore flow in the surface layer, suggestive that the mass balance requires a three-dimensional closure. Finally, we suggest that the flow reversal provides a significant fraction of cool water to the evolving upwelling center, and that the offshore veering is due to enhanced friction over a shoaling and rougher topography.},

abstract = {A preliminary assessment of accuracy of a two-sites shore-based HF Radar network along the Venice Lagoon littoral was attempted by means of comparison with a 57.5 day-long ADCP current time series for the period September-October 2002. Results showed that radar measurements were accurate ({\textless} 7 cm/s) in more than 50{\%} of the times, since more than 50{\%} of the differences between both E-W (U) and N-S (V) components were under 7 cm/s, and more than 50{\%} of direction differences were under 35°. The main differences between the HF radar and surface ADCP currents can be explained in terms of random errors affecting the measurement technique and the daily sea breeze forcing, since low-pass filtering of current time series significantly improved the correlation and decreased the RMS of the differences between the two measured data set. Comparison of the semidiurnal (M2, S2) tidal band suggested good agreement between tidal ellipse amplitudes. Wind forcing on a daily time-scale (sea-breeze) was associated with larger differences between radar and ADCP currents at a diurnal band due to the presence of a vertical shear in the surface layer. {\textcopyright} Societ{\`{a}} Italiana di Fisica.},

abstract = {Oil spills are a major contributor to marine pollution. The objective of this work is to simulate the oil spill trajectory of oil released from a pipeline leaking in the Gulf of Mexico with the GNOME (General NOAA Operational Modeling Environment) model. The model was developed by NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) to investigate the effects of different pollutants and environmental conditions on trajectory results. Also, a Texture-Classifying Neural Network Algorithm (TCNNA) was used to delineate ocean oil slicks from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations. During the simulation, ocean currents from NCOM (Navy Coastal Ocean Model) outputs and surface wind data measured by an NDBC (National Data Buoy Center) buoy are used to drive the GNOME model. The results show good agreement between the simulated trajectory of the oil spill and synchronous observations from the European ENVISAT ASAR (Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar) and the Japanese ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) PALSAR (Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) images. Based on experience with past marine oil spills, about 63.0{\%} of the oil will float and 18.5{\%} of the oil will evaporate and disperse. In addition, the effects from uncertainty of ocean currents and the diffusion coefficient on the trajectory results are also studied. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The first sustained glider observations in the Middle Atlantic Bight are used to describe the seasonal evolution of hydrographic fields off New Jersey. Near-surface temperatures respond to the seasonal cycle of surface heating, while waters at depth are primarily influenced by advection of cold waters from the north in the cold-pool during spring/ summer, and warming due to mixing during fall. The thermocline thickness increases in the offshore direction. Salinity presents seasonal variability due to river discharge and wind variations, with low-salinity waters spanning {\^{a}}ˆ¼100 km across the shelf from May to September in a {\^{a}}ˆ¼10 m thick surface layer. Stratification intensifies from April/May to late summer, especially within 80 km from the coast. The pycnocline deepens in the water column during late summer, while the passage of storms during fall rapidly reduces the stratification. The glider high-resolution observations allowed for unprecedented detailed characterization of the spatial scales of variability. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.},

The ML method (MLM) results from the application of the ML principle to the statistics of the observed raw data. The standard multiple signal classification (MUSIC) procedure, called MUSIC-1, is obtained as a brute-force approximation of the MLM. An improved MUSIC procedure, named MUSIC-2, is obtained by applying the ML principle to the statistics of certain linear combinations of the sample noise space eigenvectors. A procedure which compromises between the good performance of the MLM and the computational simplicity of MUSIC is a method of direction estimation (MODE-1) which is derived as a large sample realization of the MLM. A fifth method, called MODE-2, is obtained by using the ML principle on the statistics of certain linear combinations of the sample eigenvectors. MODE-2 is computationally less demanding than the MLM (it is of the same complexity as MODE-1) and statistically more efficient. A numerical comparison of these five DOA estimation methods is presented. It confirms the analytic results on their theoretical performance levels },

abstract = {From the beginning of the 1980s, many second-order (SO) high-resolution direction-finding methods, such as the MUSIC method (or 2-MUSIC), have been developed mainly to process efficiently the multisource environments. Despite of their great interests, these methods suffer from serious drawbacks such as a weak robustness to both modeling errors and the presence of a strong colored background noise whose spatial coherence is unknown, poor performance in the presence of several poorly angularly separated sources from a limited duration observation and a maximum of N-1 sources to be processed from an array of N sensors. Mainly to overcome these limitations and in particular to increase both the resolution and the number of sources to be processed from an array of N sensors, fourth-order (FO) high-resolution direction-finding methods have been developed, from the end of the 1980s, to process non-Gaussian sources, omnipresent in radio communications, among which the 4-MUSIC method is the most popular. To increase even more the resolution, the robustness to modeling errors, and the number of sources to be processed from a given array of sensors, and thus to minimize the number of sensors in operational contexts, we propose in this paper an extension of the MUSIC method to an arbitrary even order 2q (qges1), giving rise to the 2q-MUSIC methods. The performance analysis of these new methods show off new important results for direction-finding applications and in particular the best performances, with respect to 2-MUSIC and 4-MUSIC, of 2q-MUSIC methods with q gt;2, despite their higher variance, when some resolution is required},

The SVD of a matrix constructed from the observed signal data provides the key step in a robust discrimination between desired signals and disturbing signals in terms of signal and noise subspaces. The methods that are presented are distinguished by the way in which the subspaces are determined and how the signal or system model parameters are extracted from these subspaces.

The HF radar performance is evaluated by means of comparison between a drifter buoy trajectory and the one simulated using a Lagrangian trajectory model. A methodology to optimize the transport model performance and to calculate the search area of the predicted positions is proposed. This method is applied to data collected during the Galicia HF Radar Experience. This experiment was carried out to explore the capabilities of this technology for operational monitoring along the Spanish coast. Two long-range HF radar stations were installed and operated between November 2005 and February 2006 on the Galician coast. In addition, a drifter buoy was released inside the coverage area of the radar. The HF radar currents, as well as numerical wind data were used to simulate the buoy trajectory using the TESEO oil spill transport model. In order to evaluate the contribution of HF radar currents to trajectory analysis, two simulation alternatives were carried out. In the first one, wind data were used to simulate the motion of the buoy. In the second alternative, surface currents from the HF radar were also taken into account. For each alternative, the model was calibrated by means of the global optimization algorithm SCEM-UA (Shuffled Complex Evolution Metropolis) in order to obtain the probability density function of the model parameters. The buoy trajectory was computed for 24 h intervals using a Monte Carlo approach based on the results provided in the calibration process. A bivariate kernel estimator was applied to determine the 95{\%} confidence areas. The analysis performed showed that simulated trajectories integrating HF radar currents are more accurate than those obtained considering only wind numerical data. After a 24 h period, the error in the final simulated position improves using HF radar currents. Averaging the information from all the simulated daily periods, the mean search and rescue area calculated using HF radar currents, is reduced by approximately a 62{\%} in comparison with the search area calculated without these data. These results show the positive contribution of HF radar currents for trajectory analysis, and demonstrate that these data combined with atmospheric forecast models, are of value for trajectory analysis of oil spills or floating objects. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A surface current observation system based on high-frequency Coastal Ocean Dynamics Application Radar (CODAR) has been developed for Raritan Bay and the coastal waters of New York and New Jersey. This unique oceanographic tool is capable of measuring currents and waves at the ocean surface using resonant Bragg scatter return from transmitted radio signals. Surface current is measured by analysing the high-frequency (HF) radar sea-echo for the Doppler frequency shift where the frequencies of the first-order (FO) Doppler peaks that separate the surface current reflectance from the higher-order receiver signals are empirically determined.The presence of strong currents and horizontal shear in the near-surface flow results in spreading of the FO Doppler region, making it difficult to distinguish FO Doppler peaks from higher-order signals. Differentiating the FO Doppler region using empirical frequency cut-off parameters is one of the important steps in spectral processing of the HF radar receiver signals. The present work focuses on the surface current circulation in Raritan Bay and the New York Bight (NYB) Apex using HF radar observations, and to understand the importance of empirical determination of the FO Doppler region of the HF radar system in a strong, tidally dominated estuarine-ocean circulation. Comparison of HF radar observations with historic mooring observation and three-dimensional ocean model simulation shows that the HF radar system is highly sensitive to FO Doppler region settings. Strong tidal currents and wave-current interaction introduces spreading of the FO Doppler spectrum which results in underestimation of surface currents near the mouth of the New York/New Jersey (NY/NJ) harbour estuary.},

abstract = {Near-surface currents in Monterey Bay derived from a network of shore-based HF radars are presented for August-December 1994 and compared with those from April to September 1992. Focus is placed on the low-frequency (2- to 30-day period) motions in the remotely sensed data and on comparison of radar-derived currents with moored current and wind observations, ship-based acoustic Doppler current profiler observations, satellite-based surface temperature imagery, and surface drifter velocities. The radar-derived picture of the late summer mean flow is very similar in the two realizations and is consistent with historical data. Flow is equatorward in the outer part of the bay, poleward in a narrow band nearshore, and very sluggish in the middle of the bay. Low-pass-filtered time series of radar-derived currents are highly correlated with moored current observations and with winds in the outer part of the bay. The vector time series are also coherent across a broad frequency band with currents typically in phase between 1- and 9-m depths and with l-m currents typically 40 degrees -60 degrees to the right of the wind. Overall, these results confirm the utility of Coastal Ocean Dynamics Applications Radar (CODAR)-type HF radars for the study of coastal surface currents out to ranges {\~{}}50 km from shore, particularly for highly averaged fields. Data variability and comparison with in situ observations for high-frequency (1- to 48-hour period) motions point to the need to better characterize and minimize sources of error in the radar observations.

Eddies propagate equatorward along the shelf edge, sometimes progressing shoreward before dissipating one to three hours later. They are distinctly different from Gulf Stream meander eddies, which propagate poleward. In this article, radar and mooring data are used to establish three important aspects of these new eddies: they represent an instability process operating at a previously unidentified frequency, scale, and cross-Stream position; they contribute to shoreward momentum fluxes, defining a link between Gulf Stream and outer shelf subtidal variability and illustrating a mechanism to justify locally large horizontal eddy viscosity estimates; and they transport properties across the shelf edge, importing nutrients onto the shelf and transferring heat between the Gulf Stream and the coastal ocean. },

In this paper, we explore the use of inexpensive wireless drifters as an alternative flexible infrastructure for fine-grained ocean monitoring. Surface drifters are designed specifically to move passively with the flow of water on the ocean surface and they are able to acquire sensor readings and GPS-generated positions at regular intervals. We view the fleet of drifters as a wireless ad-hoc sensor network with two types of nodes:i) a few powerful drifters with satellite connectivity, acting as mobile base-stations, and ii)a large number of low-power drifters with short-range acoustic or radio connectivity. Using real datasets from the Gulf of Maine (US) and the Liverpool Bay (UK), we study connectivity and uniformity properties of the ad-hoc mobile sensor network. We investigate the effect of deployment strategy, weather conditions as well as seasonal changes on the ability of drifters to relay readings to the end-users,and to provide sufficient sensing coverage of the monitored area. Our empirical study provides useful insights on how to design distributed routing and in-network processing algorithms tailored for ocean-monitoring sensor networks. Copyright 2007 ACM.},

abstract = {HF radar systems are widely and routinely used for the measurement of ocean surface currents and waves. Analysis methods presently in use are based on the assumption of infinite water depth, and may therefore be inadequate close to shore where the radar echo is strongest. In this paper, we treat the situation when the radar echo is returned from ocean waves that interact with the ocean floor. Simulations are described which demonstrate the effect of shallow water on radar sea-echo. These are used to investigate limits on the existing theory and to define water depths at which shallow-water effects become significant. The second-order spectral energy increases relative to the first-order as the water depth decreases, resulting in spectral saturation when the waveheight exceeds a limit defined by the radar transmit frequency. This effect is particularly marked for lower radar transmit frequencies. The saturation limit on waveheight is less for shallow water. Shallow water affects second-order spectra ( which gives wave information) far more than first-order ( which gives information on current velocities), the latter being significantly affected only for the lowest radar transmit frequencies for extremely shallow water. We describe analysis of radar echo from shallow water measured by a Rutgers University HF radar system to give ocean wave spectral estimates. Radar-derived wave height, period and direction are compared with simultaneous shallow-water in-situ measurements.},

Tidal analyses of these data show that the currents associated with the predominant M2 constituent sweep smoothly and regularly through the area, unaffected by the finer topographic features. Moreover, contours of the amplitude of the M2 semi-major axis are mutually consistent to a precision of better than 0.5 cm s−1. Statistical analyses of these data indicate that the standard error of OSCR current measurements is less than 4 cm s−1. By contrast the major higher harmonic constituent, M4, shows pronounced, but ordered, spatial variability. Relating the observed distributions for M4 and M2 is foreseen as an instructive modeling problem that should advance our knowledge of shallow water tidal interaction processes.},

abstract = {Surface patterns of the low-frequency current in a 20 × 30 km region in front of the Venice Lagoon were analysed from a 13-month-long HF radar data set. Surface circulation was related to prevalent wind regimes in the area and to the tidal flow through the lagoon inlet. Three different categories of wind-forcing were defined: bora (NE wind), sirocco (SE wind), and finally the category containing all other wind directions and calms (winds lower than 3 m/sec). Mean flow and vorticity spatial distributions were discussed for different wind conditions. The coastal area about 5 km wide is characterized by a flow field with maximum vorticity. Outside the coastal boundary layer the interior flow is part of the Adriatic basin-wide cyclonic circulation. Two counter-rotating vortices of the dimension of about 4-5 km were evidenced in the average flow field in front of the lagoon inlet (Malamocco inlet) in all situations except for the bora. The vortex-pair is probably associated with the tidal flow through the inlet. The bora wind induces a strong southward coastal jet detached from the coast by about 5 km homogenizing the flow and eliminating the dipole. The average coastal flow pattern in calm wind conditions was also analysed as a function of the strong inflow/outflow (currents in the inlet {\textgreater} 0.7 m s-1) from the lagoon inlet. In both cases the vorticity pattern is similar, with the negative vorticity to the left of the inlet and positive to the right looking seaward. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The development and implementation of a real-time ocean forecast system based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) off the coast of central California are described. The ROMS configuration consists of three nested modeling domains with increasing spatial resolutions: the US West coastal ocean at 15-km resolution, the central California coastal ocean at 5 km, and the Monterey Bay region at 1.5 km. All three nested models have 32 vertical sigma (or terrain-following) layers and were integrated in conjunction with a three-dimensional variational data assimilation algorithm (3DVAR) to produce snapshots of the ocean state every 6 h (the reanalysis) and 48-h forecasts once a day. This ROMS forecast system was operated in real time during the field experiment known as the Autonomous Ocean Sampling Network (AOSN-II) in August 2003. After the field experiment, a number of improvements were made to the ROMS forecast system: more data were added in the reanalysis with more careful quality control procedures, improvements were made in the data assimilation scheme, as well as model surface and side boundary conditions. The results from the ROMS reanalysis are presented here. The ROMS reanalysis is first compared with the assimilated data as a consistency check. An evaluation of the ROMS reanalysis against the independent measurements that are not assimilated into the model is then presented. This evaluation shows the mean differences in temperature and salinity between reanalysis and observations to be less than 1 ??C and 0.2 psu (practical salinity unit), respectively, with root-mean-square (RMS) differences of less than 1.5 ??C and 0.25 psu. Qualitative agreement is found between independent current measurements and the ROMS reanalysis. The agreement is particularly good for the vertically integrated current along the offshore glider tracks: the ROMS reanalysis can realistically reproduce the poleward California Undercurrent. Reasonably good agreement is found in the spatial patterns of the surface current as measured by high-frequency (HF) radars. Preliminary results concerning the ROMS forecast skill and predictability are also presented. Future plans to improve the ROMS forecast system with a particular focus on assimilation of HF radar current measurements are discussed. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Increasingly accurate remote sensing techniques are available today, and methods such as modal analysis are used to transform, interpolate, and regularize the measured velocity fields. Until recently, the modes used did not incorporate flow across an open boundary of the domain. Open boundaries are an important concept when the domain is not completely closed by a shoreline. Previous modal analysis methods, such as those of Lipphardt et al. ( 2000), project the data onto closed-boundary modes, and then add a zero-order mode to simulate flow across the boundary. Chu et al. ( 2003) propose an alternative where the modes are constrained by a prescribed boundary condition. These methods require an a priori knowledge of the normal velocity at the open boundary. This flux must be extrapolated from the data or extracted from a numerical model of a larger-scale domain, increasing the complexity of the operation. In addition, such methods make it difficult to add a threshold on the length scale of open-boundary processes. Moreover, the boundary condition changes in time, and the computation of all or some modes must be done at each time step. Hence real-time applications, where robustness and efficiency are key factors, were hardly practical. We present an improved procedure in which we add scalable boundary modes to the set of eigenfunctions. The end result of open-boundary modal analysis (OMA) is a set of time and data independent eigenfunctions that can be used to interpolate, extrapolate and filter flows on an arbitrary domain with or without flow through segments of the boundary. The modes depend only on the geometry and do not change in time.},

abstract = {High-frequency (HF) bistatic Doppler cross sections of the ocean surface are examined with respect to their dependency on the bistatic angle. Previously derived results which incorporate a pulsed dipole source and two orders of scatter are considered. It is trivially seen that the first-order result has a linear dependence on the cosine of the bistatic angle. The second-order echo accounts for a double scatter of incident radiation from first-order surface waves - the so-called electromagnetic term - and a single scatter from a second-order ocean wave. The latter, generally referred to as the second-order hydrodynamic term because it originates from coupling between first-order ocean waves, predominates the Doppler continuum in most regions of interest. The analysis presented here verifies that in addition to a cosine-dependent reduction in cross section magnitude with increasing bistatic angle, both components of the second-order scatter tend to zero under the condition of near-forward scatter for bistatic HF radar operation. Of course, this imposes practical limitations on the region over which a bistatically configured HF radar system may be used to remotely sense ocean surface parameters.},

abstract = {The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Association's (NOAA) 2006 Safe Seas Oil Spill Drill, conducted just outside the Golden Gate, was a prime opportunity to test the value and effectiveness of three recently deployed 13 MHz coastal radars that are part of the Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System. These Coastal Ocean Dynamic Application Radar (CODAR) systems were deployed by the Coastal Ocean Currents Monitoring Program (COCMP) to measure surface currents up to 85 km offshore from Point Reyes to just north of Half Moon Bay. CODAR systems measure surface currents by transmitting radio waves over the ocean and use the Doppler-shifted return sea echo to extract surface current velocities. Safe Seas 2006 was the first demonstrated use of High- Frequency Radar (HFR) to assist in oil-spill response in real time. Surface current maps were posted to the web hourly during the simulated oil spill to monitor surface current structure during the 48-hour exercise. NOAA's Quick Release Estuarine Buoy (QREB) was also deployed at the location of the simulated oil spill to obtain oceanographic environmental data in real time. The QREB is equipped with an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), which provided a vertical profile of currents near the location of the simulated spill. In an effort to determine the reliability of the data produced from both measurement devices during the exercise, HFR total vector data from the three coastal systems were compared to the data acquired by the QREB surface bin located at approximately 3 m depth. Also, to verify individual HFR site performance, radial data from each site were compared with their respective radial components from the QREB data. Total-vector comparison results reveal strong correlation in both the cross-shore (R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} = 0.69) and along-shore (R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} = 0.90) components with RMS differences of less than 0.09 m/s. Both instruments also observed the same dramatic shift in along-shore current - direction during the two-day exercise. Radial comparisons revealed strong correlation as well for the two HFR systems that acquired data at the QREB location. Endpoints of recovered drift cards released during the exercise also qualitatively correlate with trajectories produced from the HFR current maps. Further, tidal analyses were performed on the QREB and HFR data, utilizing Pawlowicz's widely accepted T-Tide algorithm, to further validate measurements made by these instruments. Despite the short data set, these analyses showed pronounced signals of K{\textless}sub{\textgreater}1{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and M{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} constituents in good agreement between the QREB and HFR instruments. The consistent comparison results described in this paper show that HFR can add significantly to the effectiveness of surface current mapping over a large area during oil spills and can complement the QREB measurements to enhance oil-spill response.

Numerous studies have evaluated errors associated with these devices under a host of environmental and seasonal conditions, and reliable comparisons between HF radar surface current measurements and those from other technologies indicate a range of 0.08 to 0.15 ms-1, while internal error estimates that are made using the spread of data values in a time series or spectrum from the radar systems generally lead to errors of around 0.2 ms-1. These error estimates are typically based on manufacturer-recommended operating parameters that can include up to 25 specific parameters or assumptions made about the data. In particular, one of the dominant parameters in computing ocean surface currents from SeaSonde devices is the averaging time of both the power spectra and the computed radial components of the surface current vectors. This paper explores the relative effect of temporal averaging for two SeaSonde stations inWestern Australia. By analysing 31 days of radial data, we evaluate the statistical characteristics of noise in the spectra and determine the limits to the assumption that it represents a stationary ensemble of independent samples. The improvement in accuracy as we integrate over different time intervals from 10 to 180 minutes is determined by these characteristics. These results are applied to error analysis for the radial components of surface currents and compared with the errors in the gridded values of the radial components. Finally, the effects of calibrated and uncalibrated antenna patterns on the radial components is evaluated in the context of the temporal and spatial errors.},

abstract = {Nowcasts of the surface velocity field in Monterey Bay are made for the period August 1-9, 1994, using HF radar observations blended with results from a primitive equation model. A spectral method called normal mode analysis was used. Objective spatial and temporal filtering were performed, and stream function, velocity potential, relative vorticity, and horizontal divergence were calculated over the domain. This type of nowcasting permits global spectral analysis of mode amplitudes, calculation of enstrophy, and additional analyses using tools like empirical orthogonal functions. The nowcasts reported here include open boundary flow information from the numerical model. Nowcasts using no open boundary flow information, however, still provide excellent results for locations within the observation footprint. This method, then, is useful for filtering high-resolution data like HF radar observations, even when open boundary flow information is unavailable. Also, since the nowcast velocity gradient fields were much less noisy than the observations, this may be an effective method for preconditioning high-resolution observation sets for assimilation into a numerical model.},

abstract = {Here we report on an effort to describe in detail the evolution of surface water particles in Monterey Bay from the time they first enter until the time they leave. The data used for this study are objective mappings from hourly surface currents obtained from high frequency (HF) radar measurements in Monterey Bay for the period 2 June through 4 August 1999. The basic concept is simple: compute the origin and fate of a large number of particles for every hour during the analysis period. However, analyzing and displaying the enormous amount of computed trajectory information required a new data compression technique: synoptic Lagrangian maps produced by representing each trajectory by its origin/fate and its residence time. The results show unexpected complexity and variability not apparent in the Eulerian current archive. For example, the fraction of particles that escaped to the open ocean during this period varied from about 17 to more than 92 percent. Mean particle residence times ranged from 4.5 to 11 days. The distribution of particle residence times and transport pathways varied over time scales from hours to weeks, and space scales from 2 to 40 km. The wide range of variability in particle properties reported here shows that surface transport studies in Monterey Bay require detailed wind and tidal current information over the entire bay, as well as information about the flow along the open ocean boundary.},

abstract = {This paper considers the statistical performance of the MUSIC method under the condition that two closely spaced sources impinging on an array of sensors are effectively resolved, i.e., the spectrum exhibits two peaks in the neighborhood of the true directions-of-arrival (DOA). The MUSIC algorithm is known to have an infinite resolution power in theory. However, in the presence of modeling errors, sources can not be resolved with certainty, even if the array correlation matrix is perfectly known. The focus of this paper is to predict the bias and variance of the DOA estimates taking into account the possible resolution failure of MUSIC. This performance prediction, based on our recent mathematical investigation, is new to the best of our knowledge. A general mathematical framework to derive closed form expressions of the bias and variance versus the model mismatch, conditioned on a general statistical resolution test is proposed. In order to illustrate our mathematical approach, statistical tests with one and two conditions, respectively, are investigated. The accuracy of the performance prediction is illustrated in a simulation study. It is found that the proposed approach outperforms the {\&}{\#}x201C;classical{\&}{\#}x201D; technique, which ignores the possible resolution failure of the MUSIC algorithm. Therefore, our results provide better tools for determining the necessary antenna calibration accuracy to achieve some targeted specifications on the estimator performance.},

abstract = {This study investigated the correspondence between the near-surface drifters from a mass drifter deployment near Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, and the surface current observations from a network of three high-resolution, high-frequency radars to understand the effects of the radar temporal and spatial resolution on the resulting Eulerian current velocities and Lagrangian trajectories and their predictability. The radar-based surface currents were found to be unbiased in direction but biased in magnitude with respect to drifter velocities. The radar systematically underestimated velocities by approximately 2 cm s-1 due to the smoothing effects of spatial and temporal averaging. The radar accuracy, quantified by the domain-averaged rms difference between instantaneous radar and drifter velocities, was found to be about 3.8 cm s-1. A Lagrangian comparison between the real and simulated drifters resulted in the separation distances of roughly 1 kmover the course of 10 h, or an equivalent separation speed of approximately 2.8cm s-1. The effects of the temporal and spatial radar resolution were examined by degrading the radar fields to coarser resolutions, revealing the existence of critical scales (1.5-2km and 3 h) beyond which the ability of the radar to reproduce drifter trajectories decreased more rapidly. Finally, the importance of the different flow components present during the experiment-mean, tidal, locally wind-driven currents, and the residual velocities-was analyzed, finding that, during the study period, a combination of tidal, locally wind-driven, and mean currents were insufficient to reliably reproduce, with minimal degradation, the trajectories of real drifters. Instead, a minimum combination of the tidal and residual currents was required. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

@article{Borovikov2005,
abstract = {Abstract One of the most difficult aspects of ocean-state estimation is the prescription of the model forecast error covariances. The paucity of ocean observations limits our ability to estimate the covariance structures from model–observation differences. In most practical applications, simple covariances are usually prescribed. Rarely are cross covariances between different model variables used. Here a comparison is made between a univariate optimal interpolation (UOI) scheme and a multivariate OI algorithm (MvOI) in the assimilation of ocean temperature profiles. In the UOI case only temperature is updated using a Gaussian covariance function. In the MvOI, salinity, zonal, and meridional velocities as well as temperature are updated using an empirically estimated multivariate covariance matrix. Earlier studies have shown that a univariate OI has a detrimental effect on the salinity and velocity fields of the model. Apparently, in a sequential framework it is important to analyze temperature and salinit...},

@article{Shadden2005,
abstract = {This paper develops the theory and computation of Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS), which are defined as ridges of Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) fields. These ridges can be seen as finite-time mixing templates. Such a framework is common in dynamical systems theory for autonomous and time-periodic systems, in which examples of LCS are stable and unstable manifolds of fixed points and periodic orbits. The concepts defined in this paper remain applicable to flows with arbitrary time dependence and, in particular, to flows that are only defined (computed or measured) over a finite interval of time. Previous work has demonstrated the usefulness of FTLE fields and the associated LCSs for revealing the Lagrangian behavior of systems with general time dependence. However, ridges of the FTLE field need not be exactly advected with the flow. The main result of this paper is an estimate for the flux across an LCS, which shows that the flux is small, and in most cases negligible, for well-defined LCSs or those that rotate at a speed comparable to the local Eulerian velocity field, and are computed from FTLE fields with a sufficiently long integration time. Under these hypotheses, the structures represent nearly invariant manifolds even in systems with arbitrary time dependence. The results are illustrated on three examples. The first is a simplified dynamical model of a double-gyre flow. The second is surface current data collected by high-frequency radar stations along the coast of Florida and the third is unsteady separation over an airfoil. In all cases, the existence of LCSs governs the transport and it is verified numerically that the flux of particles through these distinguished lines is indeed negligible. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.
